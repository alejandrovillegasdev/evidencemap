In the homelessness map the rows are intervention categories and the columns are indicator categories. Indicators have sub-categories. For example, the employment indicator has three sub-categories: (1) employment status (paid and unpaid work), (2) earned income, and (3) forced labour and sex work. The map has four version Bubble, heat, donut&nbsp; and Mosaic which are self-explanatory.<br><br>The map shows both impact evaluations and systematic reviews. Impact evaluations are studies using quantitative approaches to measure what difference the programme made to outcomes like housing stability. Systematic reviews are studies which summarise all available relevant evidence for a particular issue or question. Systematic reviews which summarise evidence from impact evaluations are called ‘effectiveness reviews’<br><br>This EGM also identifies key ‘gaps’, cells which do not have any bubbles, indicates there no evidence.<br><br>This map was commissioned by the Centre for Homelessness Impact and created in partnership by Campbell Collaboration and Centre for Homelessness Impact.</div>";

Whether or not providing access to independent housing environments without on-site support is an effective means for stabilizing this population in the community is far less studied. Preference studies indicate a strong desire for access to independent housing, but little is known about the ability of mentally ill homeless persons to remain in independent housing when such access is provided. The McKinney Homeless Research Demonstration Project in San Diego, CA evaluated the effectiveness of using Section 8 certificates as a means of providing independent housing to the severely mentally ill homeless. Three hundred sixty-two clients took part in a long-term experimental study employing a randomized factorial design. Clients were assigned to one of two types of supportive case management (comprehensive vs. traditional) and to one of two levels of access to independent housing (using Section 8 certificates). Innovative longitudinal summaries of housing outcomes were developed based on clients' patterns of living over time. Nine different patterns of living arrangements were identified, ranging from continuous occupation of independent housing to consistently unstable housing. Access to Section 8 housing markedly increased the probability of achieving stable independent living arrangements and of continued contact with case management services. A subset of clients in all experimental conditions followed less successful housing patterns, indicating the need to develop different service programs for individuals with different needs. Overall, however, access to independent housing had very positive effects on residential stability","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hurlburt MS ; Wood PA ; Hough RL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/(SICI)1520-6629(199607)24:3<291::AID-JCOP8>3.0.CO;2-#","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691516,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5442600,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":33908796,"Title":"Cost-Utility Analysis of the Housing and Health Intervention for Homeless and Unstably Housed Person Living with HIV","ParentTitle":"AIDS and Behavior","ShortTitle":"Holtgrave (2013)","DateCreated":"2018-02-19T10:12:28.677","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-25T11:27:40.253","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2013","Month":"June","StandardNumber":"1573-3254","City":"","Country":"United States","Publisher":"Springer Science+Business Media","Institution":"","Volume":"17","Pages":"1626–1631","Edition":"","Issue":"5","Availability":"","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10461-012-0204-3","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"We present a cost-utility analysis based on data from the Housing and Health (H&H) Study of rental assistance for homeless and unstably housed persons living with HIV in Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles.

This study examined changes in health status, quality of life, substance use, health care utilization, and residential stability among 112 homeless and vulnerably housed individuals who applied to a supportive housing program in Toronto, Canada, from December 2005 to June 2007. Follow-up interviews were conducted every 6 months for 18 months. Comparisons were made between individuals who were accepted into the program (intervention) and those who were wait-listed (usual care) using repeated-measures analyses. Individuals who were accepted into the housing program experienced significantly greater improvements in satisfaction with living situation compared with individuals in the usual care group (time, F(3,3,261) = 47.68, p < 0.01; group × time, F(3,3,261) = 14.60, p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in other quality of life measures, health status, health care utilization, or substance use between the two groups over time. Significant improvement in residential stability occurred over time, independent of assigned housing group (time, F(3,3,261) = 9.96, p < 0.01; group × time, F(3,3,261) = 1.74, p = 0.17). The ability to examine the effects of supportive housing on homeless individuals was limited by the small number of participants who were literally homeless at baseline and by the large number of participants who gained stable housing during the study period regardless of their assigned housing status. Nonetheless, this study shows that highly disadvantaged individuals with a high prevalence of poor physical and mental health and substance use can achieve stable housing.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hwang SW ; Gogosis E ; Chambers C ; Dunn JR ; Hoch JS ; Aubry T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11524-011-9592-3","Keywords":"Supportive housing Homelessness Health status Health care utilization ","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691496,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691508,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691509,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"Canada","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691543,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416398,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437044,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437046,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437059,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":33965900,"Title":"The Effects of Housing Assistance on Labor Supply: Evidence from a Voucher Lottery","ParentTitle":"American Economic Review","ShortTitle":" Brian A.

This study examined the percentage of cocaine-using homeless persons (all with psychiatric distress) attaining stable housing and employment 12 months after entering a randomized trial of intensive behavioral day treatment, plus one of the following for 6 months: no housing; housing contingent on drug abstinence; housing not contingent on abstinence. Of 138 participants, the percentages with stable housing and employment at 12 months were 34.1% and 33.3%, respectively. Analyses suggested superior outcomes in trial arms that offered housing as part of the behavioral treatment. The majority of participants, however, did not achieve housing or employment, in part because of the limited capacity of the local housing programs to accommodate persons who had not achieved perfect abstinence. The findings demonstrate a helpful role for addiction treatment, and suggest a role for services to support housing of persons who reduce but do not eliminate all substance use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kertesz SG ; Mullins AN ; Schumacher JE ; Wallace D ; Kirk K ; Milby J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11414-006-9041-3","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691485,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691514,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437020,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437013,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437031,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437049,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":33965906,"Title":"The Helping Alliance in Case Management for Homeless Persons with Severe Mental Illness","ParentTitle":"Community Mental Health Journal","ShortTitle":"W.

Study participants' sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis, and residential preferences and the residential recommendations made by clinicians were measured at baseline.\r\rRESULTS:\rOverall, 76 percent of the study participants were housed at the end of the 18-month follow-up period, although 27 percent had experienced at least one episode of homelessness during the period. The number of days homeless was greater for individuals assigned to independent apartments than for those placed in staffed group homes, but only for members of minority groups.

This article describes permanent supportive housing and reviews research.\r\rMethods\rAuthors reviewed individual studies and literature reviews from 1995 through 2012. Databases surveyed were PubMed, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress, the Educational Resources Information Center, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The authors chose from three levels of evidence (high, moderate, and low) on the basis of benchmarks for the number of studies and quality of their methodology. They also described the evidence of service effectiveness.\r\rResults\rThe level of evidence for permanent supportive housing was graded as moderate. Substantial literature, including seven randomized controlled trials, demonstrated that components of the model reduced homelessness, increased housing tenure, and decreased emergency room visits and hospitalization. Consumers consistently rated this model more positively than other housing models. Methodological flaws limited the ability to draw firm conclusions. Results were stronger for studies that compared permanent supportive housing with treatment as usual or no housing rather than with other models.\r\rConclusions\rThe moderate level of evidence indicates that permanent supportive housing is promising, but research is needed to clarify the model and determine the most effective elements for various subpopulations. Policy makers should consider including permanent supportive housing as a covered service for individuals with mental and substance use disorders. An evaluation component is needed to continue building its evidence base.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rog D J; Marshall T ; Dougherty R H; George P ; Daniels A S; Ghose S S; Delphin-Rittmon M E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.201300261","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691460,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691536,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691542,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691543,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691557,"AdditionalText":"greater oerceived choice","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691546,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814919,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413936,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031519,"Title":"Randomized trial of intensive housing placement and community transition services for episodic and recidivist homeless families.","ParentTitle":"Am J Public Health.","ShortTitle":"Levitt (2013)","DateCreated":"2018-02-21T17:18:06.283","CreatedBy":"lama hishi","DateEdited":"2018-04-09T04:29:30.067","EditedBy":"Ann Jillian Adona","Year":"2013","Month":"December","StandardNumber":"","City":"new york","Country":"USA","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"103","Pages":"S348-54 ","Edition":"","Issue":"2","Availability":"","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24148053","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"OBJECTIVES:\rWe compared Home to Stay, a pilot of intensive housing placement and community transition services for episodic and recidivist homeless families, with a standard services approach.\r\rMETHODS:\rUsing intention-to-treat analyses, we conducted a modified randomized trial of 138 Home to Stay client families and a control group of 192 client families receiving standard shelter services.\r\rRESULTS:\rHome to Stay clients exited shelter more quickly than clients in the control group (Cox regression, P < .001), more commonly exited shelter with housing subsidies (75% vs 56%), stayed out of shelter longer (Cox regression, P = .011), and spent fewer total days in shelter (376 days vs 449 days).

For example, homeless veterans with mental illness were randomized to receive either case management only, or case management plus special access to a Section 8 housing voucher. However, a quarter of those randomized to the housing voucher group did not actually use the voucher, while a few of those randomized to case management actually used a housing voucher. Our goal is to estimate the causal effect of the proposed active ingredient (i.e., using a housing voucher), as opposed to the effect of being randomized to the active ingredient. The proposed instrumental variable methodology assumes that the outcome is proportional to the dose of the active ingredient and tests the significance of the instrumental variable estimate using a permutation test such as the Hodges–Lehman aligned rank statistic proposed by Rosenbaum for pair-matched data (Rosenbaum, Observational studies, 2002; The design of observational studies, 2010). This method removes unmeasured confounding when the assumptions of monotonicity and the exclusion restrictions hold; however, in practice these assumptions may not hold perfectly. Consequently, we extend and strengthen this approach by incorporating optimal full matching on the propensity to use the active ingredient, to further reduce bias and variability in the IV estimation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Marcus SM ; Weaver J ; Lim S ; Duan N ; Gibbons RD ; Rosenheck R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s10742-012-0100-3","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691486,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691485,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031524,"Title":"Social services case-management for long-term mental disorders: a randomised controlled trial.","ParentTitle":"Lancet.","ShortTitle":"Marshall (1995)","DateCreated":"2018-02-21T19:09:09.003","CreatedBy":"lama hishi","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T09:35:48.887","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"1995","Month":"February","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"UK","Publisher":"elsevier","Institution":"","Volume":"345","Pages":"409-412","Edition":"","Issue":"8947","Availability":"","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(95)90399-2","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"Case management arose in the USA as a solution to the difficulties of providing community care to people with severe mental disorders. The basic principle of the approach is that a case manager takes responsibility for a client; arranges an assessment of need, a comprehensive service plan, delivery of suitable services, and monitoring and assessment of services delivered. The case-management approach has been widely accepted, to the extent that recent legislation has made case-management the cornerstone of community care in the UK. We did a randomised controlled trial to evaluate a social services case-management team for people with long-term mental disorders. Subjects were referred from hostels for the homeless, night shelters, a general-practitioner clinic for the homeless, the Oxford City Council homelessness unit, and local voluntary-sector group homes. Of 103 subjects referred, 80 consented to be randomised to treatment or control groups. At 14-month follow-up, as assessed by standardised interviews, there were no significant differences between groups in number of needs, quality of life, employment status, quality of accommodation, social behaviour, or severity of psychiatric symptoms. In the case-management group there was a significant reduction in deviant behaviour on a standardised behaviour rating scale (REHAB) (mean = 0.79; 95% CI 0.26-1.32). It is unfortunate, in view of the limited effectiveness we have shown, that social services case-management was not evaluated in randomised controlled trials before its implementation in the UK.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Marshall M ; Lockwood A ; Gath D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(95)90399-2","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691473,"AdditionalText":"england","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031526,"Title":"Duration of homeless spells among severely mentally ill individuals: A survival analysis","ParentTitle":"journal of coomunity psychology","ShortTitle":"McBride (1998)","DateCreated":"2018-02-21T19:24:16.997","CreatedBy":"lama hishi","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T12:23:30.713","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"1998","Month":"September","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"USA","Publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","Institution":"","Volume":"26","Pages":"473-490","Edition":"","Issue":"5","Availability":"","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6629(199809)26:5%3C473::AID-JCOP6%3E3.0.CO;2-S/abstract","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"The major objective of this study was to identify predictors of the duration of homeless spells among persons with severe mental illness (SMI).

The sample consisted of 215 individuals who had participated in two experiments evaluating the effectiveness of various treatment programs for homeless individuals. Persons who received assertive community treatment exited homelessness sooner than individuals who received brokered case management, outpatient treatment, or services from a drop-in center. More assistance in finding and maintaining housing were especially predictive of shorter homeless spells. Inclusion of variables which varied over time in the model (e.g., income and frequency of service contacts) reduced the impact of many of the demographic variables in the model. This survival analysis demonstrated that the efforts of human service agencies to assist homeless mentally ill individuals do make a difference. In general, persons who received more services exited homelessness sooner.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McBride T ; Calsyn RJ ; Morse GA ; Klinkenberg WD ; Allen GA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/(SICI)1520-6629(199809)26:5<473::AID-JCOP6>3.0.CO;2-S","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691465,"AdditionalText":"Survival analysis of treatment and control group of individuals identified from earlier RCT","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691543,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691555,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437018,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031529,"Title":"Sufficient conditions for effective treatment of substance abusing homeless persons.","ParentTitle":"Drug Alcohol Depend.

After 2 months, EC subjects experienced up to 4 months of abstinent contingent work therapy (44.9% of EC subjects) and housing (37.7% of EC subjects), with day treatment available two afternoons per week. Longitudinal Wei-Lachin analyses of medians (reported alcohol use, days homeless and employed) and proportions (cocaine toxicologies) were conducted across 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up points. EC had 36% fewer positive cocaine toxicologies at 2-months and 18% fewer at 6-months than UC with regression toward baseline at 12-months. EC had 8 days fewer days of reported alcohol use in the past 30 days, 52 fewer days homeless in the past 60 days, and 10 more days employed in the past 30 days from baseline to the 12-months. UC showed no changes except a temporary increase in employment at 6-months. This is one of the first demonstrations that homeless cocaine abusers can be retained and effectively treated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Milby JB ; Schumacher JE ; Raczynski JM ; Caldwell E ; Engle M ; Michael M ; Carr J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0376-8716(96)01286-0","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691496,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691508,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691525,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691526,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691528,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437025,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031536,"Title":"Randomized Trial of Onsite Versus Referral Primary Medical Care for Veterans in Addictions Treatment","ParentTitle":"Medical care","ShortTitle":"Saxon, (2006)","DateCreated":"2018-02-21T21:12:50.707","CreatedBy":"Rana Charide","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T10:27:47.96","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2006","Month":"April","StandardNumber":"","City":"Washington","Country":"USA","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"44","Pages":"334-342","Edition":"","Issue":"4","Availability":"","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/2006/04000/Randomized_Trial_of_Onsite_Versus_Referral_Primary.7.aspx","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"Background: Patients presenting for treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) often exhibit medical comorbidities that affect functional health status and healthcare costs. Providing primary care within addictions clinics (onsite care) may improve medical and SUD treatment outcomes in this population.\r\rObjective: The objective of this study was to compare outcomes among Veterans’ Administration (VA) patients who receive medical care within the SUD clinic and those referred to a general medicine clinic at the same facility.\r\rMethods: Veterans entering SUD treatment with a chronic medical condition and no current primary care were randomized to receive primary medical care: 1) onsite in the VA SUD clinic (n = 358), or 2) in the VA general internal medicine clinic (n = 362). Subjects were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months postrandomization. Intention-to-treat analyses used random-effects regression.\r\rMeasures: Measures included SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summaries (PCS, MCS), VA service utilization, SUD treatment retention, Addiction Severity Index (ASI) scores, 30-day abstinence, and total VA healthcare costs.\r\rResults: Over the study year, patients assigned to onsite care were more likely to attend primary care (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.53–3.15) and to remain engaged in SUD treatment at 3 months (adjusted OR = 1.36; 1.00–1.84). Overall, outcomes on the MCS (but not the PCS) and the ASI improved significantly over time but did not differ by treatment condition. Total VA healthcare costs did not differ reliably across conditions.\r\rConclusions: Compared with referral care, providing primary care within a VA addiction clinic increased primary care access and initial SUD treatment retention but showed no effect on overall health status or costs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saxon AJ ; Malte CA ; Sloan KL ; Baer JS ; Calsyn DA ; Nichol P ; Chapko MK ; Kivlahan DR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/01.mlr.0000204052.95507.5c","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691486,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031537,"Title":"Effects of sustained abstinence among treated substance-abusing homeless persons on housing and employment.","ParentTitle":"Am J Public Health.

As hypothesized, subjects were more satisfied with their residential accommodations after moving into permanent housing and liked independent housing more than group living. Housing satisfaction did not vary as a consequence of the discrepancy between type of housing preferred and obtained. Life satisfaction was related to personality measures but was not affected by the move into housing or by the type of housing obtained.

No significant treatment group effects were found on income, self-esteem, or substance abuse.\r\rCONCLUSIONS:\rAssertive community treatment is superior to broker case management in assisting individuals with serious mental illness who are at risk of homelessness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morse GA ; Calsyn RJ ; Klinkenberg WD ; Trusty ML ; Gerber F ; Smith R ; Tempelhoff B ; Ahmad L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/ps.48.4.497","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691496,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691510,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691526,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691555,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437018,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031552,"Title":"The Community Reinforcement Approach With Homeless A1cohol-Dependent Individuals","ParentTitle":"Journal of consulting and clinical psychology ","ShortTitle":"Smith, (1998)","DateCreated":"2018-02-21T21:52:10.46","CreatedBy":"Rana Charide","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T09:44:32.79","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"1998","Month":"June","StandardNumber":"","City":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","Country":"USA","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"66","Pages":"541-548","Edition":"","Issue":"3","Availability":"","URL":"http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-02631-011","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"Homeless alcohol-dependent individuals were randomly assigned to receive either a behavioral intervention (i.e., the Community Reinforcement Approach [CRA]) or the standard treatment (STD) at a large day shelter.

Such practices may bias findings against recipients because disability applicants tend to be much sicker than never-applicants. Furthermore, these studies ignore the outcomes of denied claimants.\r\rOBJECTIVE:\rTo examine long-term outcomes associated with receiving or not receiving Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the most common mental disorder for which veterans seek such benefits.\r\rDESIGN:\rComparison of outcomes between successful and unsuccessful applicants for VA disability payments. Because we could not randomize the receipt of benefits, we used exact matching by propensity scores to control for potential baseline differences. We examined clinical outcomes approximately 10 years later.\r\rSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:\rStratified, nationally representative cohort of 3337 veterans who applied for VA PTSD disability benefits between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1998.\r\rMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\rAssessment on validated survey measures of PTSD; work, role, social, and physical functioning; employment; and poverty. We compared outcomes with earlier scores. Homelessness and mortality were assessed using administrative data.\r\rRESULTS:\rOf still-living cohort members, 85.1% returned usable surveys. Symptoms of PTSD were elevated in both groups. After adjustment, awardees had more severe PTSD symptoms than denied claimants but were nonetheless more likely to have had a meaningful symptom reduction since their last assessment (-6.1 vs -4.4; SE, 0.1; P = .01). Both groups had meaningful improvements of similar magnitude in work, role, and social functioning (-0.15 vs -0.19; SE, 0.01; P = .94), but functioning remained poor nonetheless. Comparing awardees with denied claimants after adjustment, 13.2% vs 19.0% were employed (P = .11); 15.2% vs 44.8% reported poverty (P < .001); 12.0% vs 20.0% had been homeless (P = .02); and 10.4% vs 9.7% had died (P = .66).\r\rCONCLUSIONS:\rRegardless of claim outcome, veterans who apply for PTSD disability benefits are highly impaired. However, receiving PTSD benefits was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms and less poverty and homelessness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Murdoch M ; Sayer NA ; Spoont MR ; Rosenheck R ; Noorbaloochi S ; Griffin JM ; Arbisi PA ; Hagel EM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.105.","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691486,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691555,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416396,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437024,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437031,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437049,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437057,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031554,"Title":"The Efficacy of a Consumer Case Management Team: 2-Year Outcomes of a Randomized Trial","ParentTitle":" The Journal of Mental Health Administration","ShortTitle":"Solomon, (1995)","DateCreated":"2018-02-21T21:59:55.623","CreatedBy":"Rana Charide","DateEdited":"2018-04-10T10:16:33.92","EditedBy":"Lovely Tolin","Year":"1995","Month":"March","StandardNumber":"","City":"Colorado","Country":"USA","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"22","Pages":"135-146","Edition":"","Issue":"2","Availability":"","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02518754","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"This article reports the results of a randomized trial of a team of case managers who are mental health consumers compared to a team of nonconsumers.

This study examined data from an experimental trial of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) program to identify differences in the program's impact on subgroups defined by sociodemographic or clinical characteristics.\r\rMETHODS:\rData were analyzed from 259 male homeless veterans with substance abuse problems who were randomly assigned to HUD-VASH (intensive case management [ICM] plus rent subsidy vouchers), ICM only, or treatment as usual between June 1992 and December 1995. Four subgroups were defined: African American versus Caucasian, younger versus older than 42.3 years, co-occurring diagnoses of mental illness versus diagnosis of a substance use disorder only, and active versus less active substance use upon program entry. Mixed models were used to identify significant interactions between HUD-VASH assignment and each subgroup.\r\rRESULTS:\rCompared with ICM alone, HUD-VASH was associated with more positive housing outcomes for Caucasians, veterans with co-occurring mental disorders, and veterans who were active substance users. HUD-VASH was associated with more positive socioclinical outcomes for African Americans. No differences were observed in housing or socioclinical outcomes as a function of age.\r\rCONCLUSIONS:\rAmong homeless veterans with a substance use disorder, Caucasians and those with active substance use showed greater housing benefits than other veterans from HUD-VASH than from ICM alone. African Americans showed greater socioclinical benefit than Caucasians from HUD-VASH versus ICM.

Efficient and cost-effective housing methods that reduce homelessness need to be implemented. Housing Ready programs are the standard method that often has set requirements including earned income and sobriety, among others. These programs enable a subset of the homeless to become housed. However, chronically homeless persons, who use the most resources, are often not successful at enrollment or maintaining enrollment. Housing First (H1) is a method focusing on chronically homeless persons. Housing First places a client in housing and provides services after stabilization. This article assessed differences between chronically homeless persons in a H1 program and chronically homeless persons who are not in H1.\r\rMETHOD AND SAMPLE:\rA case-control study imbedded within a homeless service program collected sociodemographic and service variables, including access and barriers to care.\r\rRESULTS:\rAlthough the sample was 100% native English speaking, 22% of homeless persons reported that their providers do not speak their same language. All (100%) of participants had a disabling condition under HUD guidelines, but only 17.78% of homeless controls reported having a disabling condition. There were no differences on housing status based on income, gender, race, or age. The lack of differences between these groups indicates that a H1 program can be a clear derivation from the more common Housing Ready programs that have specific requirements for participation.\r\rIMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE:\rProvider communication may negatively impact an individual's ability to transition from homelessness. Furthermore, chronically homeless persons not in intensive case management are less likely to understand the eligibility requirements for housing and, therefore, self-disqualify because of this lack of knowledge. Intentional communication and education for chronically homeless persons are 2 examples where case managers could improve the ability of the chronically homeless to obtain housing.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Parker RD ; Albrecht HA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/NCM.0b013e31825dfc4b.","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691465,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"A multivariable logistic\rregression model with housed status as the outcome","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691514,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5442586,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031567,"Title":"A major Canadian initiative to address mental health and homelessness.","ParentTitle":"Can J Nurs Res.

Survival curves showed that after the 9-month period of active intervention, the difference between the two groups did not diminish. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies that focus on a critical time of transition may contribute to the prevention of recurrent homelessness among individuals with mental illness, even after the period of active intervention.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Susser E ; Valencia E ; Conover S ; Felix A ; Tsai WY ; Wyatt RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.87.2.256","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691483,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691512,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031576,"Title":"Does Assertive Community Outreach Improve Social Support?

This study assessed whether the ACT model of care was related to clinical and social outcomes among patients who had experienced a first episode of psychosis.\r\rMethods:\rThe sample was drawn from the Lambeth Early Onset Trial, a study of 144 patients in the United Kingdom who sought treatment for a first episode of psychosis between January 2000 and October 2001 and who were randomly assigned to a specialized early intervention modeled on ACT or standard care. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Global Assessment of Functioning, and the Significant Others Scale were administered at six-month and 18-month follow-ups.\r\rResults:\rData on social support were available at both follow-ups for 57 patients assigned to specialized care and 50 patients assigned to standard care. The two groups were similar in personal characteristics, relationship status, and living arrangements at baseline and at six-month follow-up, but by 18 months, patients in specialized care reported having a higher mean±SD number of significant others in their social networks than did standard care patients (2.40±1.20 and 1.71±1.06, respectively; p=.01). They also achieved superior clinical outcomes at 18 months, and these outcomes were associated with network size.\r\rConclusion:\rEarly intervention by using an ACT model of care may improve clinical results by reestablishing or maintaining bonds between patients and family, friends, and acquaintances.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tempier R ; Balbuena L ; Garety P ; Craig TJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.20110013","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691473,"AdditionalText":"London","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437018,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437057,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34031583,"Title":"Evaluating an Intervention for Homeless Persons: Results of a Field Experiment","ParentTitle":"Journal of consulting and clinical psychology","ShortTitle":"Toro, (1997)","DateCreated":"2018-02-22T09:09:37.947","CreatedBy":"Rana Charide","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T06:35:34.763","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"1997","Month":"June","StandardNumber":"","City":"Buffalo metropolitan area","Country":"USA","Publisher":"American Psychological Association","Institution":"","Volume":"65","Pages":"476-484","Edition":"","Issue":"3","Availability":"","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.65.3.476","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"An intensive case management intervention for homeless persons was evaluated by random assignment of 202 cases (involving 213 adults and 70 children) to the intervention or a control group.

This naturalistic, retrospective study describes an intervention (Transitional Supportive Housing and Case Management) that effectively promoted treatment admission for this high-risk group above and beyond that which could be explained by certain pretreatment factors. The clinical records of 211 military veterans referred to intensive outpatient addiction treatment were reviewed for factors related to treatment program admission, including 3 interventions designed to prevent waiting list attrition. Chi-square tests evaluated univariate predictors of treatment entry, and a hierarchical binary logistic regression evaluated several variables simultaneously. Results showed that fewer than 50% of wait-listed patients achieved treatment admission. Univariate predictors of treatment entry were not having a current partner, having a legal problem, and having had past substance use disorder treatment. The logistic regression showed that patients who received the intervention were 4.5 times more likely to enter the treatment program, and individuals with a current legal problem were 2.5 times more likely to enter treatment. Participation in a weekly support group and/or contact with a psychiatric nurse practitioner did not increase the likelihood of program admission. It may be possible to enhance treatment entry for the homeless and marginally housed by providing case management and housing services. Future research is needed to determine how the individual-level factors predicting treatment entry in this study can be used to tailor other interventions to further address the problem of waiting list attrition.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Winn JL ; Shealy SE ; Kropp GJ ; Felkins-Dohm D ; Gonzales-Nolas C ; Francis E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1037/a0031051 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691462,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691486,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691514,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691543,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437043,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5442600,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34032907,"Title":"Cost effectiveness evaluation of Three approaches to case management for homeless mentally ill clients","ParentTitle":"The American journal of psychiatry","ShortTitle":"Wolff, (1997)","DateCreated":"2018-02-22T09:38:31.727","CreatedBy":"Rana Charide","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T06:27:48.773","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"1997","Month":"March","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"USA","Publisher":"American Psychiatric Association","Institution":"","Volume":"154","Pages":"341-8","Edition":"","Issue":"3","Availability":"","URL":" https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.154.3.341","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"In this study the authors compared the cost-effectiveness of three approaches to case management for individuals with severe mental illness who were at risk for homelessness: assertive community treatment alone, assertive community treatment with community workers, and brokered case management (purchase of services).\r\rIndividuals were randomly assigned to the three treatment conditions and followed for 18 months.

Full-service partnerships (FSPs) provide housing and engage clients in treatment.\r\rObjective  To examine changes in recovery outcomes, mental health service use and costs, and quality of life associated with participation in FSPs.\r\rDesign  A quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference design with a propensity score–matched control group was used to compare mental health service use and costs of FSP with public mental health services. Recovery outcomes were compared before and after services use, and quality of life was compared cross-sectionally.\r\rSetting  San Diego County, California, from October 2005 through June 2008.\r\rParticipants  Two hundred nine FSP clients and 154 clients receiving public mental health services.\r\rMain Outcome Measures  Recovery outcomes (housing, financial support, and employment), mental health service use (use of outpatient, inpatient, emergency, and justice system services), and mental health services and housing costs from the perspective of the public mental health system.\r\rResults  Among FSP participants, the mean number of days spent homeless per year declined 129 days from 191 to 62 days; the probability of receiving inpatient, emergency, and justice system services declined by 14, 32, and 17 percentage points, respectively; and outpatient mental health visits increased by 78 visits (P < .001 each). Outpatient costs increased by $9180; inpatient costs declined by $6882; emergency service costs declined by $1721; jail mental health services costs declined by $1641; and housing costs increased by $3180 (P < .003 each). Quality of life was greater among FSP clients than among homeless clients receiving services in outpatient programs.\r\rConclusions  Participation in an FSP was associated with substantial increases in outpatient services and days spent in housing. Reductions in costs of inpatient/emergency and justice system services offset 82% of the cost of the FSP.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gilmer TP ; Stefancic A ; Ettner SL ; Manning WG ; Tsemberis S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691463,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691483,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437018,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437029,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437055,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34035020,"Title":"Specialised care for early psychosis: symptoms, social functioning and patient satisfaction: randomised controlled trial.","ParentTitle":"British Journal Of Psychiatry","ShortTitle":"Garety (2006)","DateCreated":"2018-02-22T14:42:08.73","CreatedBy":"Aya Noubani","DateEdited":"2018-05-11T08:00:50.7","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2006","Month":"January ","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"188","Pages":"37-45","Edition":"","Issue":"1","Availability":"","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16388068","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND:\rThe provision of early intervention services for people with psychosis is UK government policy, although evidence for benefit of such services is sparse.\r\rAIMS:\rTo evaluate the effects of a service providing specialised care for early psychosis (the Lambeth Early Onset Team) on clinical and social outcomes, and on service user satisfaction.\r\rMETHOD:\rOne hundred and forty-four people with psychosis, presenting to mental health services for the first or second time (if previously failed to engage in treatment), were randomly allocated to care by the early onset team or to standard care.

We describe the early phases of applying and testing an existing Veterans Affairs (VA) HIT-care management program, Care Coordination Home Telehealth (CCHT), to recently homeless Veterans in the US Department of Housing and Urban Development-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program. Peers were used to support patient participation.\r\rMETHODS:\rCCHT uses in-home messaging devices to provide health education and daily questions about clinical indicators from chronic illness care guidelines, with patient responses reviewed by VHA nurses. Patients could also receive adjunctive peer support. We used medical record review, Veteran interviews, and staff surveys to \"diagnose\" barriers to CCHT use, assess program acceptability, explore the role of peer support, and inform future quality improvement.\r\rSUBJECTS:\rFourteen eligible Veterans in HUD-VASH agreed to CCHT participation. Ten of these Veterans opted to have adjunctive peer support and the other 4 enrolled in CCHT usual care.\r\rRESULTS:\rAlthough barriers to enrollment/engagement must be addressed, this subset of Veterans in HUD-VASH was satisfied with CCHT. Most Veterans did not require support from peers to engage in CCHT but valued peer social assistance amidst the isolation felt in their scattered-site homes.\r\rCONCLUSIONS:\rHIT tools hold promise for in-home care management for recently housed Veterans. Patient-level barriers to enrollment must be addressed in the next steps of quality improvement, testing and evaluating peer-driven CCHT recruitment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gabrielian S ; Yuan A ; Andersen RM ; McGuire J ; Rubenstein L ; Sapir N ; Gelberg L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/MLR.0b013e31827808f6.","Keywords":"Homeless; disease management; peer support","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"LA, US","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691486,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691530,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691526,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691532,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691541,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691561,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416399,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437014,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437026,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437034,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437038,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437057,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34035022,"Title":"Use of integrated dual disorder treatment via assertive community treatment versus clinical case management for persons with co-occurring disorders and antisocial personality disorder.","ParentTitle":"J Nerv Ment Dis","ShortTitle":"Frisman (2009)","DateCreated":"2018-02-22T15:02:42.89","CreatedBy":"Aya Noubani","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T15:04:34.147","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2009","Month":"November","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"197","Pages":"822–828","Edition":"","Issue":"11","Availability":"","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/2009/11000/Use_of_Integrated_Dual_Disorder_Treatment_Via.5.aspx","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"We conducted secondary analyses of data from a randomized trial testing the effectiveness of Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) in delivery of integrated dual disorder treatment (IDDT) to explore the impact of IDDT delivered through ACT teams compared with standard clinical case management for dually-disordered persons with and without antisocial personality disorder (ASPD).

Without addressing these underlying substance use behaviors, parolees are significantly more likely to recidivate within 1 year of release. New Jersey is one of the first states to actively pursue substance abuse treatment options for inmates who are in the final stages of their sentences. Given the fiscal realities of tax payer-supported programs, such initiatives must clearly demonstrate economic benefits for sustainability and growth. This article conducted one of the few comprehensive economic evaluations of prerelease substance abuse treatment to determine whether Community Education Centers' programs in New Jersey generated desirable outcomes, significant economic benefits, and positive net benefits. Relative to a matched comparison group of offenders who did not receive treatment, the intervention group returned an average economic benefit of $4,307 to $6,209 over the 1-year postrelease period. These economic benefits are underscored by the fact that the treatment program is housed in a separate facility, with a lower average per diem from that of the general inmate population. These results provide quantitative economic evidence that prerelease substance abuse treatment programs have the potential to reduce recidivism and save tax payer dollars without adding to existing prison resources.\r","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"French MT ; Fang H ; Fretz R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2009.06.001","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691492,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691485,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691527,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691542,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814919,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416398,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413935,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437029,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437054,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34039373,"Title":"Evaluation of Treatment Programs for Dual Disorder Individuals:","ParentTitle":"Admin Policy Mental Health ","ShortTitle":"Fletcher (2008)","DateCreated":"2018-02-23T10:36:29.2","CreatedBy":"Aya Noubani","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T14:59:59.913","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2008","Month":"July ","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"35","Pages":"319-36","Edition":"","Issue":"4","Availability":"","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10488-008-0170-2","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"This study evaluated the effectiveness of the three approaches for treating dual disorder clients who were homeless at intake: integrated assertive community treatment (IACT), assertive community treatment only (ACTO), and standard care (SC).

The primary goals of the case management were to improve the financial and residential stability of the clients and to reduce their use of alcohol. \r\rMethod: Subjects (N = 298, 81% male) were interviewed at baseline, randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions and given follow-up interviews at 6-month intervals for 2 years. Case management services were provided for the duration of the project. Follow-up rates for the first three interviews averaged 82%. \r\rResults: Repeated measures MANCOVAs showed significant group differences favoring the case-managed group in all three areas targeted by the intervention: total income from public sources, nights spent in \"own place\" out of the previous 60 nights and days drinking out of the previous 30 days. The results held whether the three variables were analyzed jointly or separately and for alternative measures of drinking and homelessness. Although statistically significant, the group differences are generally not large. \r\rConclusions: The results indicate that case management had a beneficial effect on the clients receiving it. This effect may have been the result of an increase in services received by the case-managed clients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cox GB ; Walker RD ; Freng SA ; Short BA ; Meijer L ; Gilchrist L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.15288/jsa.1998.59.523","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA, Seatle","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691516,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691517,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691555,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437029,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437056,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5442586,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34050617,"Title":"Case Managed Residentiai Care for Homeless Addicted Veterans","ParentTitle":"Medical care","ShortTitle":"Conrad (1998)","DateCreated":"2018-02-25T00:02:43.377","CreatedBy":"Aya Noubani","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T12:52:07.46","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"1998","Month":"January","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","Institution":"","Volume":"36","Pages":"40-53","Edition":"","Issue":"1","Availability":"","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/1998/01000/Case_Managed_Residential_Care_for_Homeless.6.aspx","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"Objectives:\rThe effectiveness of case-managed residential care (CMRC) in reducing substance abuse, increasing employment, decreasing homelessness, and improving health was examined.\r\rMethods:\rA five-year prospective experiment included 358 homeless addicted male veterans 3, 6, and 9 months during their enrollment and at 12, 18, and 24 months after the completion of the experimental case-managed residential care program.

We tested the associations between the type of case manager and clinical outcomes at three time points (baseline, 3 months, and 12 months). A series of one-way repeated measures of analyses of variance were conducted on clients from ACCESS sites that hired consumer providers. Although there were significant effects of Time for almost every outcome measure (clients improved over time), there were no significant Time x Case Manager Type interactions. Staff age, race, or gender did not significantly alter the pattern of these results. Given that services provided by consumers and nonconsumers were associated with equivalent client outcomes, the present study shows, using a large sample, the ability of consumers to provide mental health services as members of a case management team.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chinman MJ ; Rosenheck R ; Lam JA ; Davidson L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691516,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691524,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416401,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437021,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34116793,"Title":"Impact of Supported Housing on Clinical Outcomes Analysis of a Randomized Trial Using Multiple Imputation Technique","ParentTitle":"The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease","ShortTitle":"An-Lin (2007)","DateCreated":"2018-02-25T19:42:23.45","CreatedBy":"Aya Noubani","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T05:48:19.357","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2007","Month":"January ","StandardNumber":"0022-3018","City":"New Haven","Country":"United States","Publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","Institution":"Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut","Volume":"195","Pages":"83–88","Edition":"","Issue":"1","Availability":"","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3073142/","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"In 1992, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the HUD-VA Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) Program to provide integrated clinical and housing services to homeless veterans with psychiatric and/or substance abuse disorders at 19 sites. At four sites, 460 subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: (1) HUD-VASH, with both Section 8 vouchers and intensive case management; (2) case management only; and (3) standard VA care.

Over2 time periods (inception to 12 months and 12-24 months), the 2 groups did not differ in terms of changes in profile shape, but they did differ in terms of changes in profile elevation. The ACT group evidenced a decrease in symptom severity during the last 12 months, whereas the control group showed an increase. Although changes in profile shape in both groups did occur, there was a significant tendency for the shape of the BPRS profiles to remain stable from the inception of the study to the 12-month assessment and from that time to the 24-month assessment.

Seventeen intervention (36%) and 9 usual care (19%) participants had undetectable viral loads (P = .051). Median viral loads were 0.89 log lower in the intervention group (P = .03). There were no statistical differences in CD4 counts.\r\rCONCLUSIONS:\rHomelessness is a strong predictor of poor health outcomes and complicates the medical management of HIV. This housing intervention improved the health of HIV-positive homeless people.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Buchanan D ; Kee R ; Sadowski LS ; Garcia D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2008.137810","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691512,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4731285,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691483,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437046,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34116800,"Title":"Does Coordination of Welfare Services Delivery Make a Difference for Extremely Disadvantaged Jobseekers?","ParentTitle":"Economic record ","ShortTitle":"JEFF (2013)","DateCreated":"2018-02-25T20:31:11.147","CreatedBy":"Aya Noubani","DateEdited":"2018-11-23T09:00:35.163","EditedBy":"Howard White","Year":"2013","Month":"December","StandardNumber":"1475-4932","City":"Australia","Country":"Australia","Publisher":"Economic Society of Australia","Institution":"Economic Society of Australia","Volume":"89","Pages":"469–489","Edition":"","Issue":"287","Availability":"","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-4932.12062","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"Fragmented welfare service delivery has been identified as a significant barrier to improving outcomes for highly disadvantaged populations.

The sample consisted of 77 clients with severe and persistent mental illness and a history of homelessness receiving either intensive case management (ICM) or standard care. Costs from the overall societal perspective were calculated by summing the direct and 'hidden' (e.g., travel time) costs associated with: (1) Agency costs (case management services), (2) governmental costs (e.g., non-agency health care costs, non-health care costs), and (3) family/friend costs. Subtracted from this initial total to reach a final societal cost were employment and/or volunteer 'benefits'. Of interest in the study was: (1) Examining the relationship between clients needs at 18 months of a two year trial, global societal costs per client for the six-month period from 18 to 24 months, and 24-month outcomes, and (2) cost-effectiveness of intensive case management over standard care from three costing perspectives (e.g., agency, government, society). Results yielded an overall average comprehensive cost of treatment (both ICM and standard care combined) per client of $57.08/day which is comparable to previous research investigating the costs of community support services. Needs did not predict six month total societal costs; however, receiving ICM and reporting more severe symptomatology predicted higher six-month agency costs. Higher total costs of services and supports predicted poorer housing stability at 24 months for our participants. Higher expenditures related to non-health care costs predicted poorer community ability at 24 months. In general, it seems that higher costs are related to poorer client functioning. Cost-effectiveness analyses revealed that ICM is more cost-effective than standard care from the perspective of the government (i.e., health-related expenses) and society overall, despite agency costs being significantly greater in ICM. Nonparametric bootstrapping methods using net monetary benefit revealed a 0.77 to 0.80 chance of ICM being a cost-effective alternative to standard care. It is clear from this study that increased costs are associated with clients who are doing the poorest in terms of symptoms, housing stability, and community ability. Despite the finding that more intensive treatment does not guarantee better clinical outcomes within our six month window, ICM is shown to be a more cost-effective treatment in the community when compared with standard care. Implications of this research are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Birnie S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.20381/ruor-19896","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"canada","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691514,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691516,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691526,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691528,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691544,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691555,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416398,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437013,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437029,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437054,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437055,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34116903,"Title":"Effectiveness of the Housing First Approach for Homeless People with Mental Health or Substance Abuse Problems ","ParentTitle":"Drug, health and society","ShortTitle":"Beaudoin (2014)","DateCreated":"2018-02-25T21:01:07.877","CreatedBy":"Aya Noubani","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T13:27:35.507","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2014","Month":"March","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"France","Publisher":"Erudit","Institution":"","Volume":"14","Pages":"43-69","Edition":"","Issue":"2","Availability":"","URL":"htt://id.erudit.org/iderudit/1037732ar","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"Homeless people who are diagnosed with substance abuse and mental illnesses often encounter problems in their homes.

ACT clients admitted between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2007 (N=4,756), were divided into three groups by their forensic status at enrollment: recent (involvement in the past six months), remote (forensic involvement was more than six months prior), and no history.

Future studies should focus on improving measurement of community integration so that it can be effectively studied as an important outcome of mental health interventions for this population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baumgartner JN ; Herman D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.201100392","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691483,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437044,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437057,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437059,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34116907,"Title":"A Multiple-City RCT of Housing First With Assertive Community Treatment for Homeless Canadians With Serious Mental Illness","ParentTitle":"Psychiatric Services","ShortTitle":"Aubry (2015)","DateCreated":"2018-02-25T21:16:37.177","CreatedBy":"Aya Noubani","DateEdited":"2018-11-22T08:22:52.647","EditedBy":"Howard White","Year":"2015","Month":"December","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"American Psychiatric Association","Institution":"","Volume":"67","Pages":"275-81","Edition":"","Issue":"3","Availability":"","URL":"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.201400587","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"Housing First with assertive community treatment (ACT) is a promising approach to assist people with serious mental illness to exit homelessness.

A major challenge for cognitive therapy has been how to modify schemas when they are so enduring and stable. We propose that because maladaptive schemas are formed through social experiences (typically abusive or neglectful ones), they might best be corrected through positive social experiences that directly challenge the schema.\r\rDesign\rTwo longitudinal studies were conducted, one with patients undergoing group cognitive-behavioural therapy (N = 92) and one with homeless individuals residing in temporary accommodation (N = 76).\r\rMethod\rIn each study, social isolation schema was measured at Time 1 and again at Time 2 following a group-based social experience (group psychotherapy or temporary residence at a community organization). A positive experience of group life was operationalized as social identification with the therapy group in Study 1 or the community organization in Study 2.\r\rResults\rIn both studies, social identification led to a significant reduction in social isolation schema. Study 2 indicated that these effects were fully mediated by the formation of ties to new social groups, such that social identification scaffolded the development of new group memberships, which in turn decreased the endorsement of maladaptive schema.\r\rConclusions\rSocial identification facilitates the correction of socially situated schema such as social isolation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cruwys T ; Dingle GA ; Hornsey MJ ; Jetten J ; Oei T P; Walter ZC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bjc.12042/abstract","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691473,"AdditionalText":"Norway","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691464,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437057,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34475771,"Title":"Providing housing first and recovery services for homeless adults with severe mental illness: Pathways to Housing, Inc., New York","ParentTitle":"Psychiatric Services","ShortTitle":"Providing housing first...

PyscINFO, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and CINAHL were searched, resulting in ten studies, involving 1,829 participants. Peer support has significant impacts on quality of life, drug/alcohol use, and social support. Common elements of peer support are identified, suggesting possible processes that underlie effective peer support. Shared experiences, role modelling, and social support are suggested to be vital aspects of peer support and moderate changes in homeless clients.

A quasi-experimental subanalysis compared outcomes for program participants (n = 251) and propensity score-matched controls (n = 251).\r\rData Collection/extraction Methods: Administrative data were linked to describe costs and use of health services, criminal activity, homelessness, and death.\r\rPrincipal Findings: In the intent-to-treat analysis, the intervention group had higher odds of outpatient mental health service use and higher prescription drug costs than controls in the postperiod. In the subanalysis, participants had fewer unplanned hospital admissions and lower associated costs; higher prescription drug costs; higher odds of long-term care service use; higher drug/alcohol treatment costs; and lower odds of homelessness.\r\rConclusions: We found no health care cost savings for disabled Medicaid beneficiaries randomized to intensive care management. Among participants, care management may have the potential to increase access to needed care, slow growth in the number and therefore cost of unplanned hospitalizations, and prevent homelessness. These findings apply to start-up care management programs targeted at high-cost, high-risk Medicaid populations.","Comments":"research; randomized controlled trial.

It updates older and broader reviews that included weaker studies or those that did not analyze permanent housing as an input and housing and mental health as primary outcomes.\r\rMethods: The literature search (1980–2013) yielded 14 studies (randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies).\r\rResults:The studies found that a majority of participants placed in experimental housing programs with case management support remained in housing for at least one year or experienced more days housed than homeless relative to a comparison group. Although this finding is in line with previous literature reviews on permanent supportive housing, this analysis found limitations in each of the 14 reviewed studies, such as attrition, selection and response bias, imprecise definitions and implementation of housing programs, and a lack of appropriate controls. Only three of the reviewed studies reported using a housing fidelity assessment tool to test whether the housing intervention was faithful to theoretical standards, and conceptions and implementation of housing varied widely across studies, threatening internal and external validity.\r\rConclusions: Pitfalls in the best available studies on permanent supportive housing programs in the United States limit the ability of research to inform the policy goal of ending chronic homelessness and demonstrate a need for further experimental research upon which to make funding and policy decisions, especially in light of prioritized federal funds.","Comments":"review.

The secondary objective is to assess participants' self-reported level of confidence, knowledge, and willingness to quit before and after participation in the student-run smoking cessation clinic.Setting: Homeless shelter in Phoenix, Arizona.Practice Description: A previously established professional and graduate student-led clinic focused on providing a wide variety of free health services to homeless populations at a homeless shelter. One service not offered was smoking cessation support; thus, a student-run smoking cessation clinic was established.Practice Innovation: Patients were provided smoking cessation education, motivational interviewing, and pharmacotherapy by health sciences professional and graduate students. Patients were then given a 2-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy and referred to the state's smoking cessation quitline. The impact of multiple concomitant smoking cessation strategies provided by students within a homeless population has not been studied previously.Evaluation: A 10-day post-referral status update on the success of contact with patients was provided to study investigators from the smoking cessation quitline. Surveys were also used to assess the patient's self-reported level of perceived benefit with the student-run smoking cessation clinic.Results: Of the 139 unique patients, 19 (13.7%) successfully contacted the smoking cessation quitline. Patients reported high baseline confidence, knowledge, and willingness related to quit attempts; they reported a small improvement in reported values after participation in the student-run clinics.Conclusion: In the homeless population, smoking cessation education, motivational interviewing, and pharmacotherapy had a low follow-up frequency with a smoking cessation quitline, but slightly increased the patient's confidence, knowledge, and willingness to quit.","Comments":"Peer Reviewed; USA.

The standard services (S group, n = 174) participants remained eligible for standard services. Access to the Australian Government income support agency's (Centrelink) administrative data provided a retention rate close to 90% over the three annual data collection points of the study (baseline, 12 months and 24 months). Both groups improved their circumstances over the two years of the trial. The results showed no statistically significant treatment effects. The effect for employment earnings was approaching significance (p = .06) with J group increasing their employment earnings to a greater extent than S group. The findings and their implications for the implementation of joined up case management, future policy and practice, and future homelessness research is discussed.","Comments":"research; tables/charts; randomized controlled trial.

The Department of Veterans Affairs has established 11 specialty programs for homeless female veterans. We present data comparing 1-year clinical outcomes in a group of veterans who did and did not receive at least 30 days of RT. Clients of the Homeless Women Veterans Programs were invited to participate in a follow-up study. They were interviewed every 3 months for 1 year. Those who received at least 30 days of RT in the 3 months after program entry (RT group) were compared with other program participants (no or <30 days RT [NRT] group) on measures of community functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and drug and alcohol use during the follow-up. The RT group had better outcomes on employment, social support, housing status, and psychiatric symptoms. They also had significantly increased use of drugs and alcohol compared with the NRT group. Data suggest that RT may have a beneficial effect on mental health outcomes in homeless women. This study, in conjunction with others, suggests that provision of stable housing may be an important element of recovery for homeless women with psychiatric problems, excluding substance use.","Comments":"research; tables/charts.

The authors investigated the cost-effectiveness of the critical time intervention program, a time-limited adaptation of intensive case management, which has been shown to significantly reduce recurrent homelessness among men with severe mental illness. \r\rMethods: Ninety-six study participants recruited from a psychiatric program in a men's public shelter from 1991 to 1993 were randomly assigned to the critical time intervention program or to usual services. Costs and housing outcomes for the two groups were examined over 18 months. \r\rResults: Over the study period, the critical time intervention group and the usual services group incurred mean costs of 52,374 dollars and 51,649 dollars, respectively, for acute care services, outpatient services, housing and shelter services, criminal justice services, and transfer income. During the same period, the critical time intervention group experienced significantly fewer homeless nights than the usual care group (32 nights versus 90 nights). For each willingness-to-pay value--the additional price society is willing to spend for an additional nonhomeless night--greater than 152 dollars, the critical time intervention group exhibited a significantly greater net housing stability benefit, indicating cost-effectiveness, compared with usual care.\r\rConclusions: Although difficult to conduct, studies of the cost-effectiveness of community mental health programs can yield rich information for policy makers and program planners. The critical time intervention program is not only an effective method to reduce recurrent homelessness among persons with severe mental illness but also represents a cost-effective alternative to the status quo.","Comments":"clinical trial; research; tables/charts.

METHODS: Information collected from homeless veterans at the time of initial outreach contact and from case managers during the housing search was used to create logistic regression models of referral into the program and successful completion of several stages in the process of obtaining stable independent housing. \r\rResults: Overall, only 8 percent of the more than 65,000 eligible veterans contacted by outreach workers were referred to the program. Those referred were more likely to be female, to have more sources of income, to have recently used VA services (including residential treatment), and to have serious mental health problems. Once in the program, 64 percent of veterans eventually moved into an apartment, and 84 percent of those who obtained an apartment were stably housed one year later. In general, activities of case managers, such as accompanying the veteran to the public housing authority and securing additional sources of income, were associated with success in the housing process. The therapeutic alliance, clients' housing preferences, and the quality of housing were unrelated to retention of housing. \r\rConclusion: This supported housing program was judged appropriate for a small percentage of eligible veterans. However, a large proportion of clients were successful in attaining permanent housing, which lends support to the effectiveness of the supported housing approach.","Comments":"research; tables/charts.

CTI offers time-limited intensive case management designed to negotiate transitions from institutional settings to community living.\r\rMethods: CTI was implemented at eight VA medical centers through a training program that used primarily teleconference-based case review. A comparison cohort (phase 1) of 278 participants was recruited before CTI was implemented, and a treatment cohort (phase 2) of 206 participants was recruited after implementation and offered CTI. Mixed-regression models were used to compare outcomes in phase 1 and phase 2 and controlled for baseline differences between participants in the two phases.\r\rResults: Measures of client service delivery show that CTI was successfully implemented at most sites. Phase 1 veterans had a better work history and more drug use at baseline than phase 2 clients had. Controlling for these differences, veterans in phase 2 on average had 19% more days housed in each 90-day reporting period over the one-year follow-up (p<.002) and 14% fewer days in institutional settings (p=.041). Veterans in phase 2 also had 19% lower Addiction Severity Index (ASI) alcohol use scores (p<.001), 14% lower ASI drug use scores (p=.003), and 8% lower ASI psychiatric problem scores (p=.001).Conclusions: A sustained training program can be used to implement CTI in systems that have little past experience with this approach and can yield improved housing and mental health outcomes.","Comments":"research; tables/charts.

Adjusting for imbalances in patient characteristics using propensity scores, respite patients were the only group that was significantly less likely to be readmitted within 90 days compared to those released to Own Care.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of \"Housing First\" on housing stability in homeless youth aged 18 to 24 years participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month randomized trial of \"Housing First\" in 5 Canadian cities. METHODS: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive \"Housing First\" (combined with assertive community treatment or intensive case management depending on their level of need) or treatment as usual. We defined our primary outcome, housing stability, as the percent of days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available. \r\rResults: Of 2148 participants who completed baseline interviews and were randomized, 7% (n = 156) were youth aged 18 to 24 years; 87 received \"Housing First\" and 69 received treatment as usual. In an adjusted analysis, youth in \"Housing First\" were stably housed a mean of 437 of 645 (65%) days for which data were available compared with youth in treatment as usual, who were stably housed a mean of 189 of 582 (31%) days for which data were available, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34% (95% confidence interval, 24%-45%; P < .001). \r\rConclusions: \"Housing First\" was associated with improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness. Future research should explore whether adaptations of the model for youth yield additional improvements in housing stability and other outcomes.","Comments":"research; tables/charts; randomized controlled trial.

Using secondary data, this study examined the housing histories of 65 assertive community treatment (ACT) clients from 2 years prior until up to 7 years after intake, totalling 407 addresses.\r\rMethod:\rWe used statistical process control to assess the significance and longevity of pre-and post-ACT changes in residential tenure and independent living. We used multivariate survival analysis to explore participant and residence characteristics associated with residential stability.\r\rResults:\rAfter 6 months in ACT, the client population showed a significant, sustained improvement in housing stability. Similarly, shortly after ACT entry, there was a marked increase in the proportion of participants living independently. At the participant level, substance abuse was the strongest predictor of residential instability; other predictors included age (30 years or younger) and sex (female). Residence characteristics also proved important; independent housing, neighbourhood income (a proxy for housing quality), and receipt of a rental subsidy were associated with significantly longer tenure, controlling for client characteristics.\r\rConclusions:\rThe timing and magnitude of the observed changes imply that ACT was effective in helping clients to achieve stable housing and to live independently. The results also underscore the importance of high-quality housing in promoting residential stability.","Comments":"research. Journal Subset: Biomedical; Canada; Peer Reviewed.

To date, most of these organisations have not used specific intervention models and the interventions which have been implemented rarely have an empirical and theoretical foundation. The present studies aim to examine the effectiveness of critical time intervention (CTI) for abused women and homeless people.\r\rMethods: In two multi-centre randomised controlled trials we investigate whether CTI, a time-limited (nine month) outreach intervention, is more effective than care-as-usual for abused women and homeless people making the transition from shelter facilities to supported or independent housing. Participants were recruited in 19 women's shelter facilities and 22 homeless shelter facilities across The Netherlands and randomly allocated to the intervention group (CTI) or the control group (care-as-usual). They were interviewed four times in nine months: once before leaving the shelter, and then at three, six and nine months after leaving the shelter. Quality of life (primary outcome for abused women) and recurrent loss of housing (primary outcome for homeless people) as well as secondary outcomes (e.g. care needs, self-esteem, loneliness, social support, substance use, psychological distress and service use) were assessed during the interviews. In addition, the model integrity of CTI was investigated during the data collection period.\r\rDiscussion: Based on international research CTI is expected to be an appropriate intervention for clients making the transition from institutional to community living.

Median monthly costs decreased to $1492 (IQR, $337-$5709) and $958 (IQR, $98-$3200) after 6 and 12 months in housing, respectively. Poisson generalized estimating equation regressions using propensity score adjustments showed total cost rate reduction of 53% for housed participants relative to wait-list controls (rate ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.88) over the first 6 months.

The impact of advance directive interventions on hospital care of homeless individuals has not been studied. The objective of this study was to determine if homeless individuals who complete an advance directive through a shelter-based intervention are more likely to have information from their advance directive documented and used during subsequent hospitalizations. The advance directive included preferences for life-sustaining treatments, resuscitation, and substitute decision maker(s). A total of 205 homeless men from a homeless shelter for men in Toronto, Canada, were enrolled in the study and offered an opportunity to complete an advance directive with the guidance of a trained counselor from April to June 2013. One hundred and three participants chose to complete an advance directive, and 102 participants chose to not complete an advance directive. Participants were provided copies of their advance directives. In addition, advance directives were electronically stored, and hospitals within a 1.0-mile radius of the shelter were provided access to the database. A prospective cohort study was performed using chart reviews to ascertain the documentation, availability, and use of advance directives, end-of-life care preferences, and medical treatments during hospitalizations over a 1-year follow-up period (April 2013 to June 2014) after the shelter-based advance directive intervention. Chart reviewers were blinded as to whether participants had completed an advance directive. The primary outcome was documentation or use of an advance directive during any hospitalization. The secondary outcome was documentation of end-of-life care preferences, without reference to an advance directive, during any hospitalization. After unblinding, charts were studied to determine whether advance directives were available, hospital care was consistent with patient preferences as documented in advance directives, and hospital resource utilization during admission. During the 1-year follow-up period, 38 participants who completed an advance directive and 37 participants who did not complete an advance directive had at least one hospitalization (36.9 vs. 36.2 %, p = 0.93). Participants who completed an advance directive were significantly more likely to have documentation or use of an advance directive in hospital, compared to participants who did not complete an advance directive (9.7 vs. 2.9 %, p = 0.047). Without reference to an advance directive, documentation of end-of-life care preferences occurred in 30.1 vs. 30.4 % of participants, respectively (p = 0.96), most often due to documentation of code status. There were no significant differences in resource utilization between admitted patients who completed and did not complete an advance directive. In conclusion, homeless men who complete an advance directive through a shelter-based intervention are more likely to have their detailed care preferences documented or used during subsequent hospitalizations.","Comments":"USA.

We compared Home to Stay, a pilot of intensive housing placement and community transition services for episodic and recidivist homeless families, with a standard services approach. Methods. Using intention-to-treat analyses, we conducted a modified randomized trial of 138 Home to Stay client families and a control group of 192 client families receiving standard shelter services. Results. Home to Stay clients exited shelter more quickly than clients in the control group (Cox regression, P < .001), more commonly exited shelter with housing subsidies (75% vs 56%), stayed out of shelter longer (Cox regression, P = .011), and spent fewer total days in shelter (376 days vs 449 days). Home to Stay performed best with clients who entered shelter within 180 days of the pilot's start date and had less impact on clients entering shelter before that time. Conclusions. Relative to standard services, Home to Stay services can accelerate exit from shelter and reduce return to shelter and total sheltered days for episodic and recidivist homeless families. Standard shelter services may be able to narrow this performance gap by incentivizing work with all episodic and recidivist homeless families.","Comments":"research; tables/charts; randomized controlled trial.

Chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems are disproportionately burdened with health-care problems and are high utilizers of emergency medical services (EMS). Single-site Housing First (HF), which provides immediate, permanent, low-barrier, nonabstinence-based, supportive housing, has been associated with reduced publicly funded service utilization. The aims of the current study were to determine whether time spent in single-site HF predicted decreases in EMS contacts 2 years subsequent to single-site HF move-in, and to describe medical conditions and injuries associated with EMS contacts in a sample of chronically homeless individuals with severe alcohol problems. Methods. Participants were 91 chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems who were enrolled in a single-site HF program between December 2005 and March 2007 in Seattle, Washington. We obtained administrative data on exposure to HF and EMS utilization for the 2 years prior to and the 2 years subsequent to participants' move-in date. EMS utilization variables included patient type (i.e., primary presenting problem), trauma/injury mechanism (i.e., EMS classification of the cause of the trauma or injury), level of care (i.e., basic life support, advanced life support), and transport destination. Results. After controlling for baseline EMS contacts, participants evinced 3% fewer EMS contacts for each additional month of single-site HF exposure. From the baseline to follow-up period, the mean number of EMS contacts declined from 15.85 (SD = 22.96) to 9.54 (SD = 15.08), representing a 54% reduction in the number of EMS contacts. Most calls were responded to by EMTs providing basic life support, and the majority resulted in transport to a local level I trauma center. The most common presenting difficulties were medical illness and trauma. Substance use and psychiatric difficulties were infrequently documented as the primary problem. Conclusions. Our findings support recent assertions that housing is health care and indicate that the amount of time spent in single-site HF is associated with significant reductions in EMS utilization for at least 2 years subsequent to move-in. These findings also underscore the high levels of medical illness and trauma exposure among chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems.","Comments":"clinical trial; research; tables/charts.

The overall objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of a relationship-based intervention for homeless youth receiving services from agencies in downtown Toronto. METHODS: The final sample included 15 homeless youth who met the study inclusion criteria. The intervention and comparison groups were compared at baseline and post-treatment on measures of mental health symptoms, hopelessness, self-esteem, resilience, and social connectedness. FINDINGS: Participants receiving the intervention demonstrated a significant improvement in social connectedness, with a trend toward decreased hopelessness. Those participants who did not receive the intervention did not demonstrate any improvements in social connectedness and hopelessness. CONCLUSION: This preliminary pilot study suggests that providing a relationship-based intervention to street-involved youth may offer promise to strengthen social relationships and to mitigate overwhelming hopelessness and despair.","Comments":"research; tables/charts.

One hundred ninety-six individuals were randomly assigned to SC, ACTO, or IACT. Approximately two years later, 85 participants were assigned to NIACT. A quasi-experimental design was employed to analyze the data. Clients in the NIACT program had better outcomes on consumer satisfaction than clients in the other conditions. Clients in NIACT, IACT, and ACTO groups had better housing outcomes than clients in SC. Clients in NIACT reduced their use of drugs more than clients in the other programs, but there was no difference between conditions on the other substance abuse variables. There was no difference between conditions on psychiatric symptoms. IACT may need to be augmented with other services to reduce substance use and produce better psychiatric outcomes for dual-disorder homeless individuals.","Comments":"research; tables/charts.

Homeless individuals' cigarette smoking rate remains an alarming 70% or greater, and this population is generally untreated with smoking cessation interventions. Furthermore, the majority of homeless smokers also abuse alcohol and other drugs, which makes quitting more difficult and magnifies the health consequences of tobacco use.Methods/design: Participants will be randomized to one of three groups, including (1) an integrated intensive smoking plus alcohol intervention using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), (2) intensive smoking intervention using CBT or (3) usual care (i.e., brief smoking cessation and brief alcohol counseling). All participants will receive 12-week treatment with a nicotine patch plus nicotine gum or lozenge. Counseling will include weekly individual sessions for 3 months, followed by monthly booster group sessions for 3 months. The primary smoking outcome is cotinine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at follow-up week 52, and the primary alcohol outcome will be breathalyzer-verified 90-day alcohol abstinence at week 52.Discussion: This study protocol describes the design of the first community-based controlled trial (n = 645) designed to examine the efficacy of integrating alcohol abuse treatment with smoking cessation among homeless smokers. To further address the gap in effectiveness of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions in the homeless population, we are conducting a renewed smoking cessation clinical trial called Power to Quit among smokers experiencing homelessness.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01932996.

Design Two-group randomized controlled trial with 26-week follow-up. Participants and setting A total of 430 homeless smokers from emergency shelters and transitional housing units in Minneapolis/ St Paul, Minnesota, USA. Intervention and measurements All participants received 8-week treatment of 21-mg nicotine patch. In addition, participants in the intervention group received six individual sessions of MI counseling which aimed to increase adherence to nicotine patches and to motivate cessation. Participants in the standard care control group received one session of brief advice to quit smoking. Primary outcome was 7-day abstinence from cigarette smoking at 26 weeks, as validated by exhaled carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine. Findings Using intention-to-treat analysis, verified 7-day abstinence rate at week 26 for the intervention group was non-significantly higher than for the control group (9.3% versus 5.6%, P = 0.15). Among participants who did not quit smoking, reduction in number of cigarettes from baseline to week 26 was equally high in both study groups (−13.7 ± 11.9 for MI versus −13.5 ± 16.2 for standard care). Conclusions Adding motivational interviewing counseling to nicotine patch did not increase smoking rate significantly at 26-week follow-up for homeless smokers.","Comments":"research; tables/charts; randomized controlled trial.

We examined the impact of enrollment in a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) homeless-tailored PCMH on health services use, cost, and satisfaction compared with enrollment in a traditional, nontailored PCMH.Methods: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, quasi-experimental, single-blinded study at 2 VHA medical centers to assess health services use, cost, and satisfaction during 12 months among 2 groups of homeless veterans: 1) veterans receiving VHA homeless-tailored primary care (Homeless-Patient Aligned Care Team [H-PACT]) and 2) veterans receiving traditional primary care services (PACT). A cohort of 266 homeless veterans enrolled from June 2012 through January 2014.Results: Compared with PACT patients, H-PACT patients had more social work visits (4.6 vs 2.7 visits) and fewer emergency department (ED) visits for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (0 vs 0.2 visits); a significantly smaller percentage of veterans in H-PACT were hospitalized (23.1% vs 35.4%) or had mental health-related ED visits (34.1% vs 47.6%). We found significant differences in primary care provider-specific visits (H-PACT, 5.1 vs PACT, 3.6 visits), mental health care visits (H-PACT, 8.8 vs PACT, 13.4 visits), 30-day prescription drug fills (H-PACT, 40.5 vs PACT, 58.8 fills), and use of group therapy (H-PACT, 40.1% vs PACT, 53.7%). Annual costs per patient were significantly higher in the PACT group than the H-PACT group ($37,415 vs $28,036). In logistic regression model of acute care use, assignment to the H-PACT model was protective as was rating health \"good\" or better.Conclusion: Homeless veterans enrolled in the population-tailored primary care approach used less acute care and costs were lower. Tailored-care models have implications for care coordination in the US Department of Veterans Affairs VA and community health systems.","Comments":"Expert Peer Reviewed; Health Promotion/Education; Peer Reviewed; Public Health; USA.

In the context of the highly generous French national health and social care system, which is easily accessible and does not require out-of-pocket payment, the French Health Ministry insists on rigorous techniques, including randomized protocols, to evaluate the impact of Housing First approaches in France\r\rMethod and Design: A prospective randomized trial was designed to assess the impact of a Housing First intervention on health outcomes and costs over a period of 24 months on homeless people with severe mental illness, compared to Treatment-As-Usual. The study is being conducted in four cities in France: Lille, Marseille, Paris and Toulouse. The inclusion criteria are as follows: over 18 years of age, absolutely homeless or in precarious housing, and possessing a 'high' level of need: diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and moderate to severe disability according to the Multnomah Community Ability Scale (score ≤ 62) and at least one of the following three criteria: 1) having been hospitalized for mental illness two or more times in any one year during the preceding five years; 2) co-morbid alcohol or substance use; and 3) having been recently arrested or incarcerated. Participants will be randomized to receiving the Housing First intervention or Treatment-As-Usual. The Housing First intervention provides immediate access to independent housing and community care. The primary outcome criterion is the use of high-cost health services (that is,, number of hospital admissions and number of emergency department visits) during the 24-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures include health outcomes, social functioning, housing stability and contact with police services. An evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of Housing First will also be conducted. A total of 300 individuals per group will be included.\r\rDiscussion: This is the first study to examine the impact of a Housing First intervention compared to Treatment-As-Usual in France. It should provide key information to policymakers concerning the cost-effectiveness and health outcomes of the Housing First model in the French context.Trial Registration: The current clinical trial number is NCT01570712.","Comments":"research; randomized controlled trial.

This study assesses whether CTI improves the quality of family relationships between family members and individuals living with serious mental illness, and examines whether changes in quality of family relationship mediated the association between the intervention and psychiatric rehospitalization outcomes. Method: This study utilizes data from a randomized controlled trial that assessed the effect of CTI in preventing homelessness. Following discharge from inpatient psychiatric treatment in New York City, 150 previously homeless persons living with serious mental illness were randomly assigned to receive usual services only or 9 months of CTI in addition to usual services. Results: Findings from mixed-effects regression models indicated that those assigned to the CTI group reported greater frequency of family contact and greater improvement in satisfaction with family relations than the comparison group during the 18-month follow-up period. Mediation analysis revealed that greater improvement in satisfaction with family relations mediated the effect of CTI on psychiatric rehospitalization outcome, but only at a modest level. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: These findings suggest that a relatively brief but targeted intervention delivered at the point of hospital discharge may contribute to strengthening family relations and that improvement in perceived family relationship quality can contribute to a reduction in psychiatric rehospitalization.","Comments":"pictorial; research; tables/charts; randomized controlled trial.

Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children-99 ages 1.5-5 years, 113 ages 6-10 years, and 99 ages 11-16 years-included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11-16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6-10 and 11-16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time. Although experimental results were scattered, they suggest that FCTI has the potential to improve mental health and school outcomes for children experiencing homelessness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shinn M ; SamuelsJ  ; Fischer SN ; Thompkins A ; Fowler PJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s10464-015-9742-y","Keywords":"adolescent\r\nadolescent behavior\r\nadult\r\ncase management\r\nchild\r\nchild behavior\r\nchild parent relation\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndepression\r\nfamily therapy\r\nfemale\r\nhomeless person\r\nhomeless youth\r\nhousing\r\nhuman\r\ninfant\r\ninterview\r\nlongitudinal study\r\nmale\r\nMental Disorders/th [Therapy]\r\nmental health service\r\nmiddle aged\r\nmother\r\nmother child relation\r\nNew York\r\npreschool child\r\nprocedures\r\npsychology\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nschool\r\nSocial Behavior Disorders/ep [Epidemiology]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691480,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691495,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691557,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691507,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437013,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5442600,"AdditionalText":"Community led housing","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34477582,"Title":"Interventions for promoting reintegration and reducing harmful behaviour and lifestyles in street-connected children and young people (Project record)","ParentTitle":"Health Technology Assessment Database","ShortTitle":"Interventions for promoting...

To explore the processes of successful intervention and models of change in this area, and to understand how intervention effectiveness may vary in different contexts.\r\rSearch methods: We searched the following bibliographic databases, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non‐governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; CINAHL; PsycINFO; ERIC; Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; LILACS; System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and IMF Libraries; BLDS (British Library for Development Studies); Google, Google Scholar.\r\rSelection criteria: The review included data from harm reduction or reintegration promotion intervention studies that used a comparison group study design and were all randomised or quasi‐randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions aimed to benefit street‐connected children and young people, aged 0 to 24 years, in all contexts.\r\rData collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were extracted on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. A meta‐analysis was conducted for some outcomes though it was not possible for all due to differences in measurements between studies. Other outcomes were evaluated narratively.\r\rMain results: We included 11 studies evaluating 12 interventions from high income countries. We did not find any sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low and middle income countries (LMICs) despite the existence of many relevant programmes. Study quality overall was low to moderate and there was great variation in the measurement used by studies, making comparison difficult. Participants were drop‐in and shelter based. We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexual risky behaviours despite the many measurements collected in the studies. The interventions being evaluated consisted of time limited therapeutically based programmes which did not prove more effective than standard shelter or drop‐in services for most outcomes and in most studies. There were favourable changes from baseline in outcomes for most particpants in therapy interventions and also in standard services. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies and equity data were inconsistently reported. No study measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. The review discussion section included consideration of the relevance of the findings for LMIC settings.\r\rAuthors' conclusions: Analysis across the included studies found no consistently significant benefit for the ‘new’ interventions compared to standard services for street‐connected children and young people. These latter interventions, however, have not been rigorously evaluated, especially in the context of LMICs. Robustly evaluating the interventions would enable better recommendations to be made for service delivery. There is a need for future research in LMICs that includes children who are on the streets due to urbanisation, war or migration and who may be vulnerable to risks such as trafficking.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coren E ; Hossain R ; Jordi PP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/ebch.1923","Keywords":"Homeless Youth [psychology] [statistics & numerical datas]\r\nLife Style\r\nPublic Health Nursing\r\nRisk Reduction Behavior\r\nSocial Adjustment\r\nAdolescent[checkword]\r\nChild[checkword]\r\nChild, Preschool[checkword]\r\nYoung Adult[checkword]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691460,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"New York, usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691473,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691496,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691510,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691512,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691527,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691530,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691533,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691541,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691543,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691544,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691545,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691557,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691561,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814919,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413936,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437018,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437044,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437046,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34477589,"Title":"Interventions to improve access to primary care for people who are homeless: a systematic review (Structured abstract)","ParentTitle":"Health Technology Assessment Database","ShortTitle":"Interventions to improve...

We evaluated the effectiveness of interventions to improve access to primary care for people who are homeless.\r\rMethods\rWe performed a systematic review to identify studies in English published between January 1, 1995, and July 8, 2015, comparing interventions to improve access to a primary care provider with usual care among people who are homeless. The outcome of interest was access to a primary care provider. The risk of bias in the studies was evaluated, and the quality of the evidence was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria.\r\rResults\rFrom a total of 4,047 citations, we identified five eligible studies (one randomized controlled trial and four observational studies). With the exception of the randomized trial, the risk of bias was considered high in the remaining studies. In the randomized trial, people who were homeless, without serious mental illness, and who received either an outreach intervention plus clinic orientation or clinic orientation alone, had improved access to a primary care provider compared with those receiving usual care. An observational study that compared integration of primary care and other services for people who are homeless with usual care did not observe any difference in access to a primary care provider between the two groups. A small observational study showed improvement among participants with a primary care provider after receiving an intervention consisting of housing and supportive services compared with the period before the intervention. The quality of the evidence was considered moderate for both the outreach plus clinic orientation and clinic orientation alone, and low to very low for the other interventions.\r\rDespite limitations, the literature identified reports of interventions developed to overcome barriers in access to primary care in people who are homeless. The interventions studied are complex and include multiple components that are consistent with proposed dimensions of access to care (availability, affordability, and acceptability).\r\rConclusions\rOur systematic review of the literature identified various types of interventions that seek to improve access to primary care by attempting to address barriers to care encountered by people who are homeless. Moderate-quality evidence indicates that orientation to clinic services (either alone or combined with outreach) improves access to a primary care provider in adults who are homeless, without serious mental illness, and living in urban centres.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Costa  ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Homeless Persons\r\nPrimary Health Care\r\nHumans[checkword]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691460,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"CANADA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691480,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691517,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691543,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814919,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437043,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413936,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437046,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34477613,"Title":"A Multiple-City RCT of Housing First With Assertive Community Treatment for Homeless Canadians With Serious Mental Illness","ParentTitle":"Psychiatric services (washington, D.C.)","ShortTitle":"Aubry (2016)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T05:44:16.533","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-11-22T08:52:23.74","EditedBy":"Howard White","Year":"2016","Month":"March","StandardNumber":"1557-9700","City":"Washington D.C","Country":"United States of America","Publisher":"United States of America, American Psychiatric Association","Institution":"","Volume":"67","Pages":"275-281","Edition":"","Issue":"3","Availability":"","URL":"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.201400587","OldItemId":"7070","Abstract":"METHODS: The study design was a randomized controlled trial conducted in five Canadian cities.

A sample of 950 high-need participants with severe mental illness, who were either absolutely homeless or precariously housed, was randomly assigned to Housing First (N=469) or treatment as usual (N=481). Housing First participants received a rent supplement, assistance to find housing, and assertive community treatment. Treatment-as-usual participants had access to all other existing programs.\r\rResult: At one-year follow-up, 73% of Housing First participants and 31% of treatment-as-usual participants resided in stable housing (p<.001, odds ratio=6.35, covariate adjusted difference=42%, 95% confidence interval [CI]=36%-48%). Improvement in overall quality of life was significantly greater among Housing First participants compared with treatment-as-usual participants (p<.001, d=.31, CI=.16-.46). Housing First participants also showed greater improvements in community functioning compared with treatment-as-usual participants (p=.003, d=.25, CI=.09-.41).\r\rConclusions: Compared with treatment as usual, Housing First produced greater improvements in housing stability, quality of life, and community functioning after one year of enrollment. The study provides support for adopting Housing First as an approach for ending chronic homelessness among persons with severe mental illness, even if they are actively symptomatic or using substances.OBJECTIVE: Housing First is a groundbreaking approach to ending chronic homelessness among people with mental illness. This article presents one-year findings from a multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Housing First with treatment as usual.","Comments":"Chez Soi","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aubry T ; Tsemberis S ; Adair C E; Veldhuizen S ; Streiner D ; Latimer E ; Sareen J ; Patterson M ; McGarvey K ; Kopp B ; Hume C ; Goering P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.201400167","Keywords":"Canada\r\nCommunity Mental Health Services [methods] [statistics & numerical data]\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHomeless Persons [statistics & numerical data]\r\nHousing [statistics & numerical data]\r\nMental Disorders [therapy]\r\nRural Population [statistics & numerical data]\r\nAdult[checkword]\r\nFemale[checkword]\r\nHumans[checkword]\r\nMale[checkword]\r\nSr-schiz","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"Canada","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691514,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691550,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437057,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437059,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34477620,"Title":"Brief Motivational Intervention With Homeless Adolescents: evaluating Effects on Substance Use and Service Utilization","ParentTitle":"Psychology of addictive behaviors","ShortTitle":"Baer (2007)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T05:44:16.533","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T13:01:37.183","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2007","Month":"December","StandardNumber":"1939-1501","City":"Washington D.C","Country":"United States of America","Publisher":"American Psychological Association","Institution":"American Psychological Association","Volume":"21","Pages":"582-586","Edition":"","Issue":"4","Availability":"","URL":"http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-18113-018","OldItemId":"7311","Abstract":"A brief motivational intervention with 117 homeless adolescents was evaluated using a randomized design and 3-month follow-up. The intervention was designed to raise youths' concerns about their substance use, support harm reduction, and encourage greater service utilization at a collaborating agency. The study was designed to strengthen initial promising results of an earlier study (P. L. Peterson, J. S. Baer, E. A. Wells, J. A. Ginzler, & S. B. Garrett, 2006). Several modifications in the clinical protocol were included to enhance engagement with the intervention. Analyses revealed no significant benefits for intervention participants when homeless youths' substance use rates were compared with those of control participants. Service utilization during the intervention period increased for those receiving the intervention but returned to baseline levels at follow-up. Participants reported overall reductions in substance use over time. Differences between sampling methods for the current and previous study are discussed, as are the limitations of brief interventions with this population. Future research needs to elucidate mechanisms of change and service engagement for highly vulnerable youth. © 2007 American Psychological Association.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baer JS ; Garrett SB ; Beadnell B ; Wells EA ; Peterson PL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1037/0893-164X.21.4.582","Keywords":"adolescent\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nfollow up\r\nhealth care utilization\r\nhealth service\r\nhuman\r\nmotivation\r\npatient satisfaction\r\nsubstance abuse\r\namphetamine\r\ncocaine\r\nopiate derivative\r\ntetrahydrocannabinol","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691511,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691541,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691545,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691561,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437034,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437038,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437043,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437044,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34477621,"Title":"Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention for Adolescents: The How, What and Where of Reducing","ParentTitle":"Proceedings of the 67th annual scientific meeting of the college on problems of drug dependence; 2005 june 19-23; orlando, florida, USA","ShortTitle":"Baer (2005)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T05:44:16.533","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-05-11T08:15:34.717","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2013","Month":"November ","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"49","Pages":"207-212","Edition":"","Issue":"2","Availability":"","URL":"10.1093/alcalc/agt165","OldItemId":"7509","Abstract":"Aim: The aim of the study was to explore the evidence base on alcohol screening and brief intervention for adolescents to\rdetermine age appropriate screening tools, effective brief interventions and appropriate locations to undertake these activities.

Financial incentives for smoking abstinence have appeared promising in nonexperimental studies of homeless smokers, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) data are lacking.\r\rMethods: We conducted a pilot RCT of financial incentives for homeless smokers. Incentive arm participants (N = 25) could earn escalating $15–$35 rewards for brief smoking abstinence (exhaled carbon monoxide <8 parts per million) assessed 14 times over 8 weeks. Control arm participants (N = 25) were given $10 at each assessment regardless of abstinence. All participants were offered nicotine patches and counseling. The primary outcome was a repeated measure of brief smoking abstinence across 14 assessments. The secondary outcome was brief abstinence at 8 weeks. Exploratory outcomes were self-reported 1-day and 7-day abstinence from (1) any cigarette and (2) any puff of a cigarette. Other outcomes included 24-hour quit attempts, nicotine patch use, counseling attendance, and changes in alcohol and drug use.\r\rResults:Compared to control, incentive arm participants were more likely to achieve brief abstinence overall (odds ratio 7.28, 95% confidence interval 2.89 to 18.3) and at 8 weeks (48% vs. 8%, p = .004). Similar effects were seen for 1-day abstinence, but 7-day puff abstinence was negligible in both arms. Incentive arm participants made more quit attempts (p = .03). Nicotine patch use and counseling attendance were not significantly different between the groups. Alcohol and drug use did not change significantly in either group.\r\rConclusions: Among homeless smokers, financial incentives increased brief smoking abstinence and quit attempts without worsening substance use. This approach merits further development focused on promoting sustained abstinence.\r\r","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baggett TP ; Chang Y ; Yaqubi A ; McGlave C ; Higgins S ; Rigotti NA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ntr/ntx178","Keywords":"adult\r\nalcohol consumption\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled clinical trial\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncounseling\r\ndrug therapy\r\nhomelessness\r\nhuman\r\nMassachusetts\r\nnormal human\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nreward\r\nsmoking cessation\r\nvulnerable population\r\nyoung adult\r\nalcohol\r\ncarbon monoxide\r\nnicotine\r\nnicotine patch","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691530,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691533,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437044,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34477644,"Title":"Can shelter-based interventions improve treatment engagement in homeless individuals with psychiatric and/or substance misuse disorders?: a randomized controlled trial","ParentTitle":"Medical care","ShortTitle":"Bradford (2005)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T05:44:16.533","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-26T14:22:44.287","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2005","Month":"August","StandardNumber":"1537-1948","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Institution":"University off Massachusetts Medical School","Volume":"43","Pages":"763-768","Edition":"","Issue":"8","Availability":"","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/2005/08000/Can_Shelter_Based_Interventions_Improve_Treatment.3.aspx","OldItemId":"7071","Abstract":"Objectives: We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a shelter-based intervention, including intensive outreach by a psychiatric social worker and availability of weekly psychiatrist visits with continuity of care to engage homeless individuals with psychiatric and substance use problems.\r\rResearch design: This was a randomized controlled trial.SUBJECTSA total of 102 individuals were referred to a shelter-based psychiatric clinic.\r\rMeasures: The primary outcome measure was first appointment attendance at a community mental health center (CMHC).

The objectives of this paper are to examine the approach to participant recruitment and community engagement at the Toronto site of the AH/CS Project, and to describe the baseline demographics of participants in Toronto.\r\rMethods\rHomeless individuals (n = 575) with either high needs (n = 197) or moderate needs (n = 378) for mental health support were recruited through service providers in the city of Toronto. Participants were randomized to Housing First interventions or Treatment as Usual (control) groups. Housing First interventions were offered at two different mental health service delivery levels: Assertive Community Treatment for high needs participants and Intensive Case Management for moderate needs participants. Demographic data were collected via quantitative questionnaires at baseline interviews.\r\rResults\rThe effectiveness of the recruitment strategy was influenced by a carefully designed referral system, targeted recruitment of specific groups, and an extensive network of pre-existing services. Community members, potential participants, service providers, and other stakeholders were engaged through active outreach and information sessions. Challenges related to the need for different sectors to work together were resolved through team building strategies. Randomization produced similar demographic, mental health, cognitive and functional impairment characteristics in the intervention and control groups for both the high needs and moderate needs groups. The majority of participants were male (69%), aged >40 years (53%), single/never married (69%), without dependent children (71%), born in Canada (54%), and non-white (64%). Many participants had substance dependence (38%), psychotic disorder (37%), major depressive episode (36%), alcohol dependence (29%), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (23%), and mood disorder with psychotic features (21%). More than two-thirds of the participants (65%) indicated some level of suicidality.\r\rConclusions\rRecruitment at the Toronto site of AH/CS project produced a sample of participants that reflects the diverse demographics of the target population.

Participants completed interviews every 6 months and measures of housing status every 3 months to a total of 24 months. We assessed housing stability as percent days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available in youth aged 18-24 years, fit a model with a three-way interaction of treatment group (age 18-24 years vs. >24 years), and compared the effect on housing stability in youth versus adults. We used a repeated measures mixed-effects model to estimate differences/ratios from baseline over 24 months for secondary health and service use outcomes.\r\rResults: Of the 2,148 total participants who were randomized, 156 were youth aged 18-24 years: 87 received Housing First and 69 received usual care. In an adjusted analysis, youth in Housing First were stably housed a mean of 437/645 (65 percent) days for which data were available compared with youth in usual care, who were stably housed a mean of 189/582 (31 percent) days, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34 percent (95% CI 24-45, P < 0.0001). The effect of the three-way interaction of treatment group, age, and time on housing stability was nonsignificant (P = 0.5934). Youth who received Housing First were less likely to have a period of employment (adjusted OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.99, P = 0.0456), but otherwise, their secondary outcomes were not significantly different from youth who received usual care. \r\rConclusions: Housing First led to improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness and appears to be no less effective in youth than in older adults. More research is needed to guide adaptations of the model to further improve housing stability and other outcomes in youth.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kozloff N ; Stergiopoulos V ; Cheung A ; Goering PN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jaac.2016.09.154","Keywords":"adult\r\ncase management\r\ncity\r\ncontrolled clinical trial\r\ncontrolled study\r\nemployment\r\ngroup therapy\r\nhomeless youth\r\nhousing\r\nhuman\r\ninterview\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmental disease\r\nmental health service\r\nmodel\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"canada","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691512,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691543,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691536,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691546,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691547,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437031,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437049,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34477851,"Title":"Fidelity of a strengths-based intervention used by dutch shelters for homeless young adults","ParentTitle":"Psychiatric services (washington, D.C.)","ShortTitle":"Krabbenborg (2015)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T05:44:22.503","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-11-29T08:03:47.823","EditedBy":"Ann Jillian Adona","Year":"2015","Month":"April","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"66","Pages":"470-476","Edition":"","Issue":"5","Availability":"","URL":"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.201300425","OldItemId":"7228","Abstract":"Objective:\rIn a cluster randomized controlled trial, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of and fidelity to Houvast (Dutch for “grip”), a strengths-based intervention to improve the quality of life for homeless young adults.\r\rMethods:\rFidelity was measured six months after professionals and team leaders at five Dutch shelters for homeless young adults finished their training in Houvast. Fidelity was measured with the Dutch version of the strengths model fidelity scale, which consists of ten indicators distributed across three subscales: structure, supervision, and clinical practice. A total fidelity score was composed by averaging the ten indicator scores for each facility. During one-day audits by two trained assessors visiting each facility, a file analysis (N=46), a focus group with homeless young adults (N=19), and interviews with the team leader and supervisor (N=9) were conducted. Professionals, supervisors, and team leaders completed questionnaires two weeks before the audit (N=43). In addition, an evaluation of the audit was conducted six months later.\r\rResults:\rAlthough none of the five shelters achieved a sufficient total model fidelity score, median scores on caseload, group supervision, and strengths assessment were satisfactory.

Housing First participants with high needs received assertive community treatment (ACT), and those with moderate needs received intensive case management (ICM). Every three months, participants were interviewed about employment and earnings in the previous months (median follow-up=745 days). Regression models were estimated via generalized estimating equations.RESULTS: ICM recipients had lower odds of obtaining employment compared with the control group with moderate needs. The odds of obtaining employment among ICM recipients increased but their employment rate never exceeded that of the control group. For ACT recipients, the odds of obtaining employment were not significantly different from those of the control group. Among Housing First participants, persons employed at baseline, men, and younger participants had greater odds of employment compared with control participants. Housing First did not appear to significantly increase income.CONCLUSIONS: This was the first large-scale randomized controlled study of Housing First's effects on employment. Further research is needed to determine how Housing First may be enhanced to increase odds of obtaining employment.OBJECTIVE: Housing First is emerging as an evidence-based practice for housing and supporting people who are homeless and have a mental illness. The objective of this study was to determine whether Housing First increases the odds of obtaining competitive employment in this population and affects income, including income from informal and illegal sources.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Poremski D ; Stergiopoulos V ; Braithwaite E ; Distasio J ; Nisenbaum R ; Latimer E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.201500002","Keywords":"Canada [epidemiology]\r\nCase Management\r\nCommunity Mental Health Services [methods]\r\nEmployment\r\nEvidence-Based Practice\r\nHomeless Persons [psychology]\r\nHousing\r\nIncome\r\nMental Disorders [epidemiology] [rehabilitation]\r\nQuality of Life\r\nRegression Analysis\r\nAdult[checkword]\r\nFemale[checkword]\r\nHumans[checkword]\r\nMale[checkword]\r\nMiddle Aged[checkword]\r\nSr-schiz","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"Canada","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691514,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691555,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437031,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437048,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34478014,"Title":"Contingency managment reduces substance use and increases healhy behaviours among homeless, out-of-treatment MSM","ParentTitle":"Journal of substance abuse treatment","ShortTitle":"Reback (2009)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T05:44:22.52","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T10:59:27.31","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2009","Month":"October","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"29","Pages":"123","Edition":"","Issue":"3","Availability":"","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2010.06.007","OldItemId":"7496","Abstract":"Homeless men who have sex with men are a particularly vulnerable population with high rates of substance dependence, psychiatric disorders, and HIV prevalence.

Two of these interventions included innovative contingency management programs specifically designed for homeless persons with cocaine disorders: Homeless 1 (n=104) and Homeless 2 (n=102). Findings are based on treatment costs obtained from actual expenditures and treatment outcomes of drug abstinence from toxicology tests. Direct costs are reported by service category and costs of abstinence at 2-, 6-, and 12-mo. Drug abstinence rates by treatment program revealed superior outcomes for the enhanced interventions with the greatest abstinence found at the earlier time points. Abstinence rates at 12 mo failed to differentiate treatment groups. It is concluded that when only the direct costs of programs and their abstinence rates are considered, treatments that involve abstinent contingent work and housing have incremental cost ratios that are within the range of many other common social and medical interventions. These enhanced programs are more cost effective earlier in treatment than at 12-mo follow-up due to relapse common among existing drug treatment.

The use of diagnostic change can be a practical addition to drug toxicology and self-report treatment outcome measures for research and practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schumacher JE ; Milby JB ; Wallace D ; Simpson C ; Frison S ; McNamara C ; Usdan S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1037/1064-1297.11.2.146","Keywords":"Ambulatory Care [methods] [psychology] [statistics & numerical data]\r\nChi-Square Distribution\r\nCocaine-Related Disorders [diagnosis] [psychology] [therapy]\r\nConfidence Intervals\r\nDisease Management\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHomeless Persons [psychology] [statistics & numerical data]\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAdult[checkword]\r\nFemale[checkword]\r\nHumans[checkword]\r\nMale[checkword]\r\nMiddle Aged[checkword]\r\nSr-addictn","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34478065,"Title":"The effect of housing interventions on neuropsychological functioning among homeless persons with mental illness","ParentTitle":"Psychiatric services (washington, D.C.)","ShortTitle":"Seidman (2003)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T05:44:22.52","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T10:04:04.88","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2003","Month":"June","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"54","Pages":"905-908","Edition":"","Issue":"6","Availability":"","URL":"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.54.6.905","OldItemId":"7250","Abstract":"The authors tested the hypotheses that neuropsychological functioning would improve after homeless persons with severe and persistent mental illness were provided with housing and that executive functioning would improve more among those placed in group homes than among those placed in independent apartments.

Overall neuropsychological functioning improved significantly across the full study sample. Executive performance, measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, decreased significantly among persons assigned to independent apartments and increased, but not significantly, among those assigned to group homes.

By providing permanent, independent housing without prerequisites for sobriety and treatment, and by offering support services through consumer-driven Assertive Community Treatment teams, Housing First removes some of the major obstacles to obtaining and maintaining housing for consumers who are chronically homeless. In this study, consumers diagnosed with severe mental illness and who had the longest histories of shelter use in a suburban county were randomly assigned to either one of two Housing First programs or to a treatment-as-usual control group. Participants assigned to Housing First were placed in permanent housing at higher rates than the treatment-as-usual group and, over the course of four years, the majority of consumers placed by both Housing First agencies were able to maintain permanent, independent housing. Results also highlight that providers new to Housing First must be aware of ways in which their practices may deviate from the essential features of Housing First, particularly with respect to enrolling eligible consumers on a first-come, first-served basis and separating clinical issues from tenant or housing responsibilities. Finally, other aspects of successfully implementing a Housing First program are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stefancic A ; Tsemberis S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s10935-007-0093-9","Keywords":"Halfway Houses [organization & administration] [utilization]\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMental Disorders\r\nProgram Development\r\nSuburban Population\r\nUnited States\r\nFemale[checkword]\r\nHumans[checkword]\r\nMale[checkword]\r\nSr-schiz","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691514,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691495,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691507,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691516,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437013,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437029,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437055,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34478365,"Title":"Abuse, support, and depression among homeless and runaway adolescents","ParentTitle":"Journal of Health & Social Behavior","ShortTitle":"Bao (2000)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:11.303","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T13:12:24.68","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2000","Month":"December","StandardNumber":"2150-6000","City":"America","Country":"United States of America","Publisher":"SAGE on behalf of American Sociological Association","Institution":"Bao, W N.

Results indicate that although abusive family origins contribute directly to depressive symptoms there are indirect effects of family abuse and early independence through social support networks.

At baseline, study participants completed measures of cognitive function, depression, and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). In 40 minutes, women were taught three skills of the Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) in the natural environment: (a) silently repeating a mantram several times, several times per day; (b) repeating the mantram slowly every night before sleep; and (c) focusing full attention on the mantram during repetitions. One week later, participants completed a second ISI. Of the 29 women recruited, 83% completed 1-week follow up. After 1 week, 88% were using their mantram daily and one half were using it prior to sleep. Insomnia severity significantly decreased (p = 0.03), with a mean difference of 2.36 (SD = 4.75). The practice of MRP, an intervention that is portable and easy to teach, shows significant promise in decreasing insomnia in this unique population.","Comments":"Barger, Mary K Weinrich, Sally Bormann, Jill E Bouvier, Monique Hardin, Sally Brosz","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barger MK ; Weinrich S ; Bormann JE ; Bouvier M ; Hardin SB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3928/02793695-20150526-03","Keywords":"Female\r\n*Homeless Persons\r\nHumans\r\n*Meditation/mt [Methods]\r\nMeditation/px [Psychology]\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPilot Projects\r\n*Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/th [Therapy]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa, sandiego","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691481,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416399,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437046,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34478384,"Title":"The utility of mentoring homeless adolescents: a pilot study","ParentTitle":"American Journal of Drug & Alcohol Abuse","ShortTitle":"Bartle-Haring (2012)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:11.303","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-05-10T11:26:01.717","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2012","Month":"July","StandardNumber":"1097-9891","City":"","Country":"United States of America","Publisher":"Taylor & Francis","Institution":"Bartle-Haring, Suzanne.

Furthermore, we were not able to identify a study that examined the potential utility of mentoring for homeless adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the impact of mentoring among a group of homeless adolescents who were also receiving substance abuse treatment. \r\rMethods: This pilot study examined the impact of mentoring among homeless adolescents (n = 90) between the ages of 14 and 20 years who also received substance abuse treatment. A longitudinal design was used in which adolescents were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and following the completion of treatment at 6 months postbaseline. \r\rResults: Findings showed that adolescents with a history of physical or sexual abuse attended more mentoring sessions. Also, mentoring in addition to treatment was associated with a decrease in problem consequences associated with substance use. However, more mentoring with fewer treatment sessions was associated with an increase in internalizing behaviors. Only these two outcomes were associated with mentoring. \r\rConclusions and Scientific Significance: While not providing resounding support for mentoring, this study suggests that examining the mentor/mentee relationship may be a fruitful line of future research given that significant variability among the mentor/mentee pairs was noted for some outcomes of interest.","Comments":"Bartle-Haring, Suzanne Slesnick, Natasha Collins, Jennifer Erdem, Gizem Buettner, Cynthia","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bartle-Haring S ; Slesnick N ; Collins J ; Erdem G ; Buettner C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/00952990.2011.643985","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\n*Child Abuse/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nChild Abuse, Sexual/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\n*Homeless Youth\r\nHumans\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\n*Mentors\r\nPilot Projects\r\n*Substance-Related Disorders/rh [Rehabilitation]\r\nTime Factors\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691526,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416399,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437025,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691489,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437044,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34478400,"Title":"The impact of housing first and peer support on people who are medically vulnerable and homeless","ParentTitle":"Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal","ShortTitle":"Bean (2013)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:11.303","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T13:25:49.547","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2013","Month":"March","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"United States","Publisher":"American Psychological Association\t","Institution":"Bean, Kristen F.

However, many live in substandard accommodations that are physically inadequate, crowded, noisy and located in undesirable neighbourhoods. In much of the research on housing for persons with SPMI, the central outcome of interest is remaining housed; however, it is worth investigating whether housing has other benefits. This paper is a systematic review of studies that investigated the relationship between housing-related independent variables and health-related dependent variables. Ten online databases were searched for studies published since 1980 that had study populations of adults with SPMI, analysed primary or secondary empirical data, and measured housing-related independent variables and health-related dependent variables. Clearly defined epidemiological criteria were used to assess the strength of evidence of the selected studies. Twenty-nine studies met the suitability criteria, of which 14 reported healthcare utilisation outcomes; 12 examined mental status outcomes; and 9 reported quality-of-life outcomes. The findings of the review suggest that there is good evidence that housing interventions benefit the homeless population; however more research is needed about housing solutions for individuals with SPMI who are housed, but in precarious or inappropriate housing situations. Study methodologies could be improved by emphasising longitudinal designs that focus on participant retention and by implementing matched control groups or randomised interventions to strengthen internal validity. Ensuring that a person is adequately housed upon discharge from hospital should be a treatment priority. When housing eligibility is not dependent on psychiatric treatment compliance and sobriety, providing permanent housing minimises harm and may free people to voluntarily seek treatment. Housing that offers an unlimited length of stay is recommended because SPMI is a chronic and fluctuating condition that requires stable surroundings to maintain health.

A program evaluation of a New York City supportive housing program has assessed the association between supportive housing tenancy and Medicaid savings among New York City housing program applicants with serious mental illness and chronic homelessness or dual diagnoses of mental illness and substance use disorder, stratified by distinctive Medicaid expenditure patterns. METHODS: The evaluation used matched data from administrative records for 2827 people. Sequence analysis identified 6 Medicaid expenditure patterns during 2 years prior to baseline among people placed in the program (n=737) and people eligible but not placed (n=2090), including very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditure, low, middle, high, and very high Medicaid expenditure patterns. We assessed the impact of the program on Medicaid costs for 2 years post-baseline via propensity score matching and bootstrapping. RESULTS: The housing program was associated with Medicaid savings during 2 years post-baseline (-$9526, 95% CI=-$19,038 to -$2003). Stratified by Medicaid expenditure patterns, Medicaid savings were found among those with very low Medicaid coverage (-$15,694, 95% CI=-$35,926 to -$7983), increasing Medicaid expenditures (-$9020, 95% CI=-$26,753 to -$1705), and high Medicaid expenditure patterns (-$14,450, 95% CI=-$38,232 to -$4454). Savings were largely driven by shorter psychiatric hospitalizations in the post-baseline period among those placed. CONCLUSIONS: The supportive housing program was associated with Medicaid savings, particularly for individuals with very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditures, and high Medicaid expenditures pre-baseline.","Comments":"Lim, Sungwoo Gao, Qi Stazesky, Elsa Singh, Tejinder P Harris, Tiffany G Levanon Seligson, Amber","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lim S ; Gao Q ; Stazesky E ; Singh T P; Harris T G; Levanon Seligson ; A  ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12913-017-2816-9","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa, New York","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691542,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691485,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691545,"AdditionalText":"Enrolment in managed care.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"Assumed due to less hospitalization pattern","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691565,"AdditionalText":"Decrease in total medical costs due to less hospitalization ","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416396,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437029,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437056,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34479987,"Title":"Resource-limited, collaborative pilot intervention for chronically homeless, alcohol-dependent frequent emergency department users","ParentTitle":"American Journal of Public Health","ShortTitle":"McCormack (2013)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:40.58","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T09:51:37.95","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2013","Month":"December","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"McCormack, Ryan P.

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of 151 families with a homeless adolescent aged 12 to 17 years. Between March 2006 and June 2009, adolescents were recruited from diverse sites in Southern California and were assessed at recruitment (baseline), and at 3, 6, and 12 months later. Families were randomly assigned to an intervention condition with five weekly home-based intervention sessions or a control condition (standard care). Main outcome measures reflect self-reported sexual risk behavior, substance use, and delinquent behaviors over the past 90 days. RESULTS: Sexual risk behavior (e.g., mean number of partners; p < .001), alcohol use (p = .003), hard drug use (p < .001), and delinquent behaviors (p = .001) decreased significantly more during 12 months in the intervention condition compared with the control condition. Marijuana use, however, significantly increased in the intervention condition compared with the control condition (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: An intervention to reengage families of homeless youth has significant benefits in reducing risk over 12 months.","Comments":"Milburn, Norweeta G Iribarren, Francisco Javier Rice, Eric Lightfoot, Marguerita Solorio, Rosa Rotheram-Borus, Mary Jane Desmond, Katherine Lee, Alex Alexander, Kwame Maresca, Katherine Eastmen, Karen Arnold, Elizabeth Mayfield Duan, Naihua","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Milburn NG ; Iribarren FJ ; Rice E ; Lightfoot M ; Solorio R ; Rotheram-Borus M J; Desmond K ; Lee A ; Alexander K ; Maresca K ; Eastmen K ; Arnold E M; Duan N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.08.009","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nChild\r\nFamily Therapy/mt [Methods]\r\n*Family Therapy\r\nFemale\r\n*Homeless Youth/px [Psychology]\r\nHumans\r\n*Juvenile Delinquency/pc [Prevention & Control]\r\nJuvenile Delinquency/px [Psychology]\r\nMale\r\nRisk-Taking\r\n*Substance-Related Disorders/pc [Prevention & Control]\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/px [Psychology]\r\n*Unsafe Sex/pc [Prevention & Control]\r\nUnsafe Sex/px [Psychology]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691530,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691533,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691536,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691546,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691480,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437025,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437044,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34480050,"Title":"To house or not to house: the effects of providing housing to homeless substance abusers in treatment","ParentTitle":"American Journal of Public Health","ShortTitle":"Milby (2005)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:40.58","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T09:59:29.853","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2005","Month":"July","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"Milby, Jesse B.

We examined how treatment outcomes were affected under 3 different housing provision conditions. METHODS: We studied 196 cocaine-dependent participants who received day treatment and no housing (NH), housing contingent on drug abstinence (ACH), or housing not contingent on abstinence (NACH). Drug use was monitored with urine testing. RESULTS: The ACH group had a higher prevalence of drug abstinence than the NACH group (after control for treatment attendance), which in turn had a higher prevalence than the NH group. All 3 groups showed significant improvement in maintaining employment and housing. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this and previous trials indicate that providing abstinence-contingent housing to homeless substance abusers in treatment is an efficacious, effective, and practical intervention. Programs to provide such housing should be considered in policy initiatives.","Comments":"Milby, Jesse B Schumacher, Joseph E Wallace, Dennis Freedman, Michelle J Vuchinich, Rudy E","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Milby JB ; Schumacher JE ; Wallace D ; Freedman MJ ; Vuchinich RE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2004.039743","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAlabama\r\nCocaine-Related Disorders/ep [Epidemiology]\r\n*Cocaine-Related Disorders/th [Therapy]\r\nFemale\r\n*Homeless Persons/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPrevalence\r\n*Public Housing","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691508,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691496,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691516,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437013,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437018,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34480120,"Title":"Treating homeless clients with severe mental illness and substance use disorders: costs and outcomes","ParentTitle":"Community Mental Health Journal","ShortTitle":"Morse (2006)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:40.58","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T10:04:52.067","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2006","Month":"August","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"Morse, Gary A.

METHODS: Semistructured narrative interviews were conducted with 219 participants in five Canadian cities at baseline; 197 were interviewed again at 18 months after random assignment to Housing First (N=119) or treatment as usual (N=78). Interviews were coded across 13 life domains, and each participant was categorized as reporting positive, mixed-neutral, or negative changes. Housing First and treatment as usual participants were compared with respect to change patterns. Thematic analysis was used to examine factors related to various changes. RESULTS: The percentage of participants in Housing First reporting positive changes was more than double that for participants in treatment as usual, and treatment as usual participants were four times more likely than Housing First participants to report negative changes. Factors related to positive changes included having stable good-quality housing, increased control over substance use, positive relationships and social support, and valued social roles. Factors related to negative changes included precarious housing, negative social contacts, isolation, heavy substance use, and hopelessness. Factors related to mixed-neutral changes were similar to those for participants reporting negative changes but were less intense. CONCLUSIONS: Housing First with intensive support was related to more positive changes among homeless adults with mental illness across five Canadian cities. Those with poor housing or support, more common in treatment as usual, continued to struggle. These findings are relevant for services and social change to benefit this population.","Comments":"Nelson, Geoffrey Patterson, Michelle Kirst, Maritt Macnaughton, Eric Isaak, Corinne A Nolin, Danielle McAll, Christopher Stergiopoulos, Vicky Townley, Greg MacLeod, Timothy Piat, Myra Goering, Paula N","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nelson G ; Patterson M ; Kirst M ; Macnaughton E ; Isaak C A; Nolin D ; McAll C ; Stergiopoulos V ; Townley G ; MacLeod T ; Piat M ; Goering P N; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.201400201","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCanada\r\nFemale\r\n*Homeless Persons/px [Psychology]\r\n*Housing\r\nHumans\r\n*Life Change Events\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/px [Psychology]\r\n*Mental Disorders/rh [Rehabilitation]\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nQualitative Research\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nSocial Isolation\r\n*Social Support\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/px [Psychology]\r\n*Substance-Related Disorders/rh [Rehabilitation]\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"Canada","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691467,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691514,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437044,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437057,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34480368,"Title":"Trajectories of recovery among homeless adults with mental illness who participated in a randomised controlled trial of Housing First: a longitudinal, narrative analysis","ParentTitle":"BMJ Open","ShortTitle":"Patterson (2013)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:44.973","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-05-11T07:27:15.697","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2013","Month":"September","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"Patterson, Michelle L.

We expected that participants who received Housing First (HF) would describe more positive trajectories of recovery than those who were assigned to Treatment as Usual (TAU; no housing or support provided through the study). DESIGN: Narrative interview data were collected from participants at baseline and 18 months after random assignment to HF or TAU. SETTING: Participants were sampled from the community in Vancouver, British Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-four participants were randomly and purposively selected from the larger trial; 52 were interviewed at baseline and 43 were reinterviewed 18 months after randomisation. METHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted at both time points. For each participant, paired baseline and follow-up narratives were classified as positive, negative, mixed or neutral trajectories of recovery, and thematic analysis was used to identify the factors underlying different trajectories. RESULTS: Participants assigned to HF (n=28) were generally classified as positive or mixed trajectories; those assigned to TAU (n=15) were generally classified as neutral or negative trajectories. Positive trajectories were characterised by a range of benefits associated with good-quality, stable housing (eg, reduced substance use, greater social support), positive expressions of identity and the willingness to self-reflect. Negative, neutral and mixed trajectories were characterised by hopelessness ('things will never get better') related to continued hardship (eg, eviction, substance use problems), perceived failures and loss. CONCLUSIONS: HF is associated with positive trajectories of recovery among homeless adults with mental illness. Those who did not receive housing or support continued to struggle across a wide range of life domains. Findings are discussed with implications for addressing services and broader social change in order to benefit this marginalised population.","Comments":"Patterson, Michelle L Rezansoff, Stefanie Currie, Lauren Somers, Julian M","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Patterson ML ; Rezansoff S ; Currie L ; Somers JM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003442","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"Canada","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691467,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437059,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34480487,"Title":"Short-term street soccer improves fitness and cardiovascular health status of homeless men","ParentTitle":"European Journal of Applied Physiology","ShortTitle":"Randers (2012)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:49.317","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T11:03:01.38","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2012","Month":"June","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"Randers, Morten B.

Exercise capacity, maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), body composition (DXA scans), blood pressure (BP), and blood lipid profile were determined before and after the intervention period for 22 soccer-group subjects (SG) and 10 waiting list controls (CO). In addition, time-motion analyses, HR measurements, and pedometer recordings were performed during street soccer training and daily-life activities. During a 60 min 4 versus 4 street soccer session 182 +/- 62 intense running bouts were performed; mean HR was 82 +/- 4% HR(max) and HR was >90% HR(max) for 21 +/- 12% (+/-SD) of total time. On a day without training the participants performed 10,733 +/- 4,341 steps and HR was >80% HR(max) for 2.4 +/- 4.3 min. In SG, VO(2max) was elevated (p < 0.05) from 36.7 +/- 7.6 to 40.6 +/- 8.6 ml/min/kg after 12 weeks and incremental cycle test performance was improved (p < 0.05) by 81 s (95% CI: 47-128 s). After 12 weeks, fat percentage (19.4 +/- 8.5 to 17.5 +/- 8.6%) and LDL cholesterol (3.2 +/- 1.1 to 2.8 +/- 0.8 mmol L(-1)) were lowered (p < 0.05) in SG. The observed changes in SG were different (p < 0.05) from CO and no intra-group changes occurred for CO (p > 0.05). BP was unaltered after 12 weeks (p > 0.05), but diastolic BP was lowered for all SG subjects with pre-values >75 mmHg (83 +/- 6 to 76 +/- 6 mmHg, n = 8, p < 0.05). In conclusion, the exercise intensity is high during street soccer and regular street soccer training can be used as an effective activity to promote physical fitness and cardiovascular health status for homeless men.","Comments":"Randers, Morten B Petersen, Jesper Andersen, Lars Juel Krustrup, Birgitte R Hornstrup, Therese Nielsen, Jens J Nordentoft, Merete Krustrup, Peter","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Randers MB ; Petersen J ; Andersen LJ ; Krustrup BR ; Hornstrup T ; Nielsen JJ ; Nordentoft M ; Krustrup P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007%2Fs00421-011-2171-1","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBlood Glucose/me [Metabolism]\r\nBlood Pressure/ph [Physiology]\r\nBody Composition/ph [Physiology]\r\nCardiovascular Physiological Phenomena\r\nCholesterol, LDL/bl [Blood]\r\n*Exercise/ph [Physiology]\r\nHeart Rate/ph [Physiology]\r\n*Homeless Persons\r\nHumans\r\nLipoproteins/bl [Blood]\r\nMale\r\nOxygen Consumption/ph [Physiology]\r\n*Physical Fitness/ph [Physiology]\r\n*Soccer/ph [Physiology]\r\nTask Performance and Analysis\r\n0 (Blood Glucose)\r\n0 (Cholesterol, LDL)\r\n0 (Lipoproteins)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691473,"AdditionalText":"Denmark","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691463,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34480762,"Title":"Smoking cessation among sheltered homeless: a pilot","ParentTitle":"American Journal of Health Behavior","ShortTitle":"Shelley (2010)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:53.683","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-05-11T06:31:32.26","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2010","Month":"September","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"Shelley, Donna.

Counseling plus pharmacotherapy options may be effective in helping sheltered homeless smokers quit.","Comments":"Shelley, Donna Cantrell, Jennifer Wong, Selena Warn, Doug","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shelley D ; Cantrell J ; Wong S ; Warn D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5993/AJHB.34.5.4","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nCarbon Monoxide/an [Analysis]\r\n*Cognitive Therapy\r\nFemale\r\n*Homeless Persons\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNew York City\r\nPsychotherapy, Group\r\n*Smoking Cessation/mt [Methods]\r\n*Tobacco Use Disorder/dt [Drug Therapy]\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691495,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691506,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691530,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691533,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416393,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34480828,"Title":"A comparison of three interventions for homeless youth evidencing substance use disorders: results of a randomized clinical trial","ParentTitle":"Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment","ShortTitle":"Slesnick (2015)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:21:53.683","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T11:21:45.543","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2015","Month":"July","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"Slesnick, Natasha.

The current study builds upon prior research showing promising findings of the community reinforcement approach (CRA) (Slesnick, Prestopnik, Meyers, & Glassman, 2007). Homeless adolescents and young adults between the ages of 14 to 20 years were randomized to one of three theoretically distinct interventions: (1) CRA (n = 93), (2) motivational enhancement therapy (MET, n = 86), or (3) case management (CM, n = 91). The relative effectiveness of these interventions was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that substance use and associated problems were significantly reduced in all three interventions across time. Several moderating effects were found, especially for sex and history of childhood abuse. Findings show little evidence of superiority or inferiority of the three interventions and suggest that drop-in centers have choices for addressing the range of problems that these adolescents and young adults face.","Comments":"Slesnick, Natasha Guo, Xiamei Brakenhoff, Brittany Bantchevska, Denitza","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Slesnick N ; Guo X ; Brakenhoff B ; Bantchevska D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAge Factors\r\nCase Management\r\nChild\r\nChild Abuse\r\nEthnic Groups\r\nFemale\r\n*Homeless Youth/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMotivation\r\nMotivational Interviewing\r\nPatient Participation/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nSex Factors\r\nSexual Behavior\r\n*Substance-Related Disorders/rh [Rehabilitation]\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691515,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691517,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691527,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437025,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34481558,"Title":"Effective Interventions for Homeless Youth: A systematic review","ParentTitle":"American Journal of Preventive Medicine","ShortTitle":"Altena (2010)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:22:59.39","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T12:50:21.437","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2010","Month":"June","StandardNumber":"0749-3797, 0749-3797","City":"Netherlands","Country":"Netherlands","Publisher":"Elsevier","Institution":"Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands, Department of Primary and Community Care—Centre for Family Medicine, Geriatric Care, and Public Health, Nijmegen, The NetherlandsAdams-Guppy, Julie R.: guppy.j@st-annes.oxon.org","Volume":"38","Pages":"637-645","Edition":"","Issue":"6","Availability":"","URL":" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2010.02.017","OldItemId":"13718","Abstract":"Context: To date, there has not been clear evidence regarding interventions that are effective in addressing the specifıc needs of homeless youth. A systematic and comprehensive international review on effective interventions for homeless youth is presented. This study seeks to provide an accurate and complete picture of effective interventions for homeless youth by collecting, summarizing, categorizing, and evaluating quantitative studies (i.e., those that have assessed treatment outcomes).\r\rEvidence acquistion: The following databases were searched in 2008: PsycINFO, ERIC, MEDLINE, and Cochrane were searched from 1985 through 2008 using specifıc key words: interventions and programs, with homeless youth (s), homeless adolescents, street youth (s), runaways and throwaways. In addition, references of key articles were searched by hand. Eleven studies met preestablished inclusion criteria. To determine study quality, a set of operational parameters was formulated to rate each study as either good, fair, or poor.\r\rEvidence synthesis: There is no compelling evidence that specifıc interventions are effective for homeless youth, owing to moderate study quality and the small number of intervention studies. Conclusions that can be drawn from the studies are limited by the heterogeneity of interventions,\rparticipants, methods, and outcome measures. Many interventions focused on reduction of substance abuse, whereas other important outcomes, such as quality of life, have received little attention. No study received a quality rating of good, and four studies were rated as fair. Most convincing, but still marginal, were results of interventions based on cognitive– behavioral approaches, which revealed some positive results on psychological measures.\r\rConclusions: More methodologically sound research is needed to determine what specifıc interventions are benefıcial for subgroups of homeless youth. Implications for future research are discussed.\r","Comments":"Date revised - 2010-10-21 Last updated - 2016-09-28 CODEN - AJPMEA SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - Homeless persons; Youth; Social policy; Substance abuse; United States; Quality of life","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Altena AM ; Brilleslijper-Kater SN ; Wolf JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.amepre.2010.02.017","Keywords":"Social conditions and policy - Social conditions and problems\r\nPopulation groups, population policy, and demographics - Children and youth\r\nSocial conditions and policy - Social policy and social development\r\nSocial conditions and policy - Drinking, smoking, and drug addiction\r\nEconomic conditions and policy - Economic conditions\r\nHomeless persons\r\nSocial policy\r\nUnited States\r\nYouth\r\nSubstance abuse\r\nQuality of life\r\narticle","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691460,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":" -U.S.: fıve in Seattle; two in Albuquerque;\rone in Los Angeles; one in the southeastern U.S. \r -Canada\r","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691472,"AdditionalText":"South Korea","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691515,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691526,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691545,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691550,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691524,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814919,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413936,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437018,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437020,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437044,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34481616,"Title":"Contribution of a shelter-based survey for screening respiratory diseases in the homeless","ParentTitle":"European Journal of Public Health","ShortTitle":"Badiaga (2009)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:22:59.407","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-05-11T08:15:49.413","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2009","Month":"January","StandardNumber":"11011262","City":"Marseille ","Country":"France","Publisher":"Oxford University Press","Institution":"Faculté de médecine, Marseille, France","Volume":"19","Pages":"157-60","Edition":"","Issue":"2","Availability":"","URL":"10.1093/eurpub/ckn142","OldItemId":"15174","Abstract":"Background: The homeless are at very high risk for both respiratory diseases and poor access to health care delivery systems. The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of a shelter-based survey to identify respiratory diseases in the homeless population in Marseilles, in order to further develop preventive interventions. \r\rMethods: A prevalence survey of respiratory diseases was conducted in two homeless shelters in Marseilles, in February 2005. A multidisciplinary team including infectious diseases specialists, lung specialists, residents, nurses, physiotherapists and X-ray technicians visited the two shelters. Interview, physical examination, sputum sampling for Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection, nasal swabs for virus detection and chest X-rays were performed in shelters. Chest X-rays were subsequently analyzed by a pneumonologist and subjects found to have radiological abnormalities were hospitalized for further investigations. \r\rResults: Of the 221 homeless persons enrolled, 110/221 (50%) had at least one respiratory manifestations. Chest X-rays were abnormal in 14 persons. Active tuberculosis was diagnosed in two, influenza in two, respiratory syncytial virus infection in two, acute pneumonia in one, asthma in two, lung cancer in one, acute bronchitis in 23, chronic bronchitis in 42, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 22 persons, respectively. \r\rConclusion: Our shelter-based survey, including clinical evaluation and chest radiographic screening, shows that this approach can be useful to control and prevent respiratory diseases among the homeless. However, further studies are necessary to determine the magnitude of influenza in the homeless, the impact of influenza immunization and optimal frequency of interventions in shelters.","Comments":"Copyright - © The Author 2009.

Respite care provides homeless individuals with housing and services allowing more complete recovery from illnesses and stabilization of chronic conditions. We investigated respite care's impact on 225 hospitalized homeless adults consecutively referred from an urban public hospital during a 26-month period. The cohort was separated into 2 groups: (1) patients referred and accepted into the respite center and (2) patients referred but denied admission because beds were unavailable. All patients met the center's predefined eligibility criteria. Main outcome measures were inpatient days, emergency department visits, and outpatient clinic visits. The 2 groups had similar demographic characteristics, admitting diagnoses, and patterns of medical care use at baseline. During 12 months of follow-up, the respite care group required fewer hospital days than the usual care group (3.7 vs 8.3 days; P=.002), with no differences in emergency department or outpatient clinic visits. Individuals with HIV/AIDS experienced the greatest reduction in hospital days. Respite care after hospital discharge reduces homeless patients' future hospitalizations.","Comments":"Copyright - Copyright American Public Health Association Jul 2006 Document feature - Tables; Graphs; References Last updated - 2017-10-31 CODEN - AJPHDS","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Buchanan D ; Doblin B ; Sai T ; Garcia P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2005.067850","Keywords":"Medical Sciences\r\nStudies\r\nHomeless people\r\nMortality\r\nHospitalization\r\nHospital systems\r\nHospital costs\r\nMedical records\r\nConfidence intervals\r\nReferrals\r\nData analysis\r\nEmergency medical care\r\nFacilities\r\nCase management\r\nHealth services\r\nReferral & Consultation\r\nEmergency Service, Hospital -- utilization\r\nOutcome Assessment (Health Care)\r\nChicago\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nHospitalization -- statistics & numerical data\r\nHealth Services Needs & Demand\r\nHomeless Persons -- statistics & numerical data\r\nOutpatient Clinics, Hospital -- utilization\r\nAdult\r\nFemale\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nProgram Evaluation\r\nRespite Care\r\nCohort Studies\r\nAftercare -- utilization\r\nHospitals, Urban -- utilization\r\nHalfway Houses -- utilization\r\nHomeless Persons -- psychology\r\nHospitals, Public -- utilization","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691483,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691512,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691542,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691566,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416391,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437046,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34481847,"Title":"The Effectiveness of a Consultation Model in Community Mental Health","ParentTitle":"Occupational Therapy In Mental Health","ShortTitle":"Chapleau (2012)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:23:03.75","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T05:45:25.377","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2012","Month":"October","StandardNumber":"0164212X","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"Taylor and Francis","Institution":"","Volume":"28","Pages":"379-95","Edition":"","Issue":"4","Availability":"","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0164212X.2012.708609","OldItemId":"14100","Abstract":"This one-year study explored the impact of an occupational therapy consultation model on housing status and goal attainment among 57 people with severe mental illness who were homeless or at risk of homelessness.

By providing a small rental subsidy to eligible individuals and their families who are already stably housed, the philosophy of the program is to prevent homelessness before it starts. The housing outcomes of 185 PI clients were compared to those of 218 people who were not enrolled in the program but were presumed eligible for it, controlling for sociodemographic, HIV disease, and behavioral health characteristics. Using survival analysis techniques, non-program participants were found to be more likely to leave their rental housing at any given point in time compared to PI program participants. After one year of follow-up, while 99% of PI clients remained stably housed in their program-subsidized rental unit, only 32% of comparison group clients were still in rental housing. At two years, 96% of PI participants remained independently housed, compared to only 10% of non-participants. The success of the program suggests that Project Independence should be replicated and evaluated in other jurisdictions where a relatively high incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS is combined with a lack of affordable housing for low income households.

For this multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, 183 adults who were moving from shelters in the Netherlands to supported or independent housing were allocated to CTI or care-asusual. The primary outcome was number of days rehoused, which was assessed by interviewing participants four times during a 9-month follow-up. Outcomes were analyzed with three-level mixed-effects models. The primary outcome did not differ between groups. CTI had a significant effect on family support and, for people experiencing less social support, psychological distress. Groups did not differ significantly on social support, fulfillment of care needs, quality of life, self-esteem, excessive alcohol use, or cannabis use. Because few participants were homeless at 9 months, more research is needed to establish whether CTI can prevent long-term recurrent homelessness. Given recent emphasis on informal support in public services and positive effects of CTI on family support and psychological distress, CTI is a fitting intervention for Dutch shelter services.","Comments":"Copyright - Copyright Blackwell Science Ltd.

The literature offers many examples of using evidence-based supported employment models with vulnerable populations to assist them in obtaining and maintaining competitive employment; yet few examples exist to date with homeless young adults with mental illness. Objective: The purpose of this study was thus to adapt an evidence-based intervention for adults with psychiatric illnesses [i.e., the Individual Placement and Support (IPS)] with homeless young adults with mental illness. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 20 homeless young adults (ages 18-24) with mental illness from the host agency. Participants received the IPS intervention over 10 months. A comparison sample was used at a separate agency of 16 homeless young adults with mental illness, who received standard agency services. Using a pre-post, self-comparison quasi-experimental design, the impact of the IPS was assessed on five employment outcomes: (1) ever-worked rate, (2) working-at-follow-up rate, (3) monthly work rate, (4) weekly work hours and (5) weekly income. Results: The IPS group was significantly more likely to have worked at some point over the 10-month study as well as to have worked a greater number of months overall. Conclusions: Findings provide greater insight into adapting, implementing and evaluating the IPS model with homeless young adults with mental illness. The study demonstrates that the IPS model is adaptable to work with homeless young adults with mental illness and is associated with successful retention and employment outcomes.","Comments":"Last updated - 2017-11-28 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 8531 8847 2768; 10364 3425; 5470; 4819 8016 4542; 6531 2877; 11654 226 316 8016 4542; 11106; 6752 9651 6582; 3425; 1955 3629 6582","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ferguson KM ; Xie B ; Glynn S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007%2Fs10566-011-9163-5","Keywords":"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nIntervention\r\nComparative Analysis\r\nQuasiexperimental Design\r\nEmployment\r\nMental Disorders\r\nYoung Adults\r\nModels\r\nSupported Employment\r\nUnemployment\r\nHomeless People","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa, new york","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691524,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691516,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691555,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691557,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416398,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437020,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437031,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437048,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437049,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34482145,"Title":"Family Unification Program: Housing Services for Homeless Child Welfare-Involved Families","ParentTitle":"Housing Policy Debate","ShortTitle":"Fowler (2014)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:23:07.79","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T12:00:51.037","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2014","Month":"October","StandardNumber":"10511482","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"24","Pages":"802","Edition":"","Issue":"4","Availability":"","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2014.881902","OldItemId":"14023","Abstract":"The Family Unification Program -- a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development initiative to facilitate interagency collaboration between the child welfare and public housing service systems -- aims to stabilize families at risk for parent-child separation by addressing housing needs.

Method: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 10 Dutch shelter facilities randomly allocated to an intervention and a control group. Homeless young adults were interviewed when entering the facility and when care ended. Repeated-measures analyses and logistic regression analyses were conducted by the principle of intention-to-treat framework (N = 251). Results: Improvements were demonstrated on quality of life; satisfaction with family relations, finances, and health; employed or in school; depression; care needs; autonomy; competence, and resilience in both conditions. A higher proportion of homeless young adults who received care according to Houvast were still receiving care at follow-up and successfully completed the trajectory compared to those who received care as usual. Conclusion: Homeless young adults seem to benefit from service provision in general. Further research on the effectiveness of Houvast is needed after sufficient model fidelity has been achieved.","Comments":"Last updated - 2017-11-28 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - Randomized Controlled Trials; 5470; 11654 226 316 8016 4542; 4819 8016 4542; 4109 4335; 3378 4878 3760; 5472 3629 6582; 8522; 3851 5449 8768; 5019; 4634; 3433 10103; 3170 28 96; 2746 8415; 6996; 7736; 1970 1; 8901; 8299; 8166 10789 6447; 11465 8522; 10411; 6532 4634; 10306 909; 10087 2574 3629 6582; 547 8415; 5449 8768; 8751 10087 2574 3629 6582","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Krabbenborg MA ; Boersma SN ; van der Veld WM ; van Hulst B ; Vollebergh WA ; Wolf JR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/1049731515622263","Keywords":"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nIntervention\r\nCompetence\r\nIncome\r\nNeeds\r\nPersonal Autonomy\r\nMental Health\r\nForeign Countries\r\nSubstance Abuse\r\nFamily Relationship\r\nDepression (Psychology)\r\nPretests Posttests\r\nResilience (Psychology)\r\nAnxiety\r\nInterviews\r\nStatistical Analysis\r\nHomeless People\r\nProgram Effectiveness\r\nEducational Attainment\r\nHealth\r\nYoung Adults\r\nRegression (Statistics)\r\nWell Being\r\nEmployment Level\r\nInterpersonal Relationship\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials\r\nEmergency Shelters\r\nQuality of Life\r\nSymptoms (Individual Disorders)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691473,"AdditionalText":"holland","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691527,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691524,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691557,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437025,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437031,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437049,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437057,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437059,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34482607,"Title":"Reducing AIDS and Substance Abuse Risk Factors among Homeless, HIV-Infected, Drug-Using Persons","ParentTitle":"Research on Social Work Practice","ShortTitle":"Lewis (2000)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:23:18.56","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T12:23:10.573","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2000","Month":"January","StandardNumber":"1049-7315, 1049-7315","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"c/o Boyle -- School Social Work, U Georgia, Lawrenceville","Volume":"10","Pages":"15-33","Edition":"","Issue":"1","Availability":"","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/15527581-00010001-05","OldItemId":"14888","Abstract":"Investigates the impact of a comprehensive day program of HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome) education, housing support, & 12-step recovery for HIV-infected homeless persons in Atlanta, GA.

Homeless veterans (n = 181) entering outpatient VA substance use treatment were randomized to AHCM and HSG and received treatment for 12 months. AHCM provided individualized housing, substance use and mental health case management, life skills training, and community outreach. The control condition was a weekly drop-in housing support group. Adjusted longitudinal analyses compared groups on baseline to month 12 change in percentage of days housed and functional status, substance use, and mental health outcomes (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey; Addiction Severity Index [ASI]). Negative binomial regression models compared groups on health care utilization. Both conditions significantly increased percentage of days housed, with no differences detected between conditions. In total, 74 (81.3%) AHCM and 64 (71.1%) HSG participants entered long-term housing (odds ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval [0.9, 4.0], p = .088). HSG participants experienced a greater decrease in emergency department visits than AHCM (p = .037), whereas AHCM participants remained in substance use treatment 52.7 days longer (p = .005) and had greater study treatment participation (p < .001) than HSG. ASI alcohol composite scores improved more for HSG than AHCM (p = .006), and both conditions improved on ASI drug and psychiatric scores and alcohol/drug abstinence. AHCM did not demonstrate overarching benefits beyond standard VA housing and substance use care. For those veterans not entering or losing long-term housing, different approaches to outreach and ongoing intervention are required.","Comments":"Copyright - Copyright American Psychological Association May 2017 Last updated - 2017-10-06","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malte CA ; Cox K ; Saxon AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1037/adb0000273","Keywords":"Psychology\r\nIntensive case management\r\nFunctional status\r\nVeterans\r\nOutpatient treatment\r\nAddiction\r\nSkills training\r\nSeverity\r\nHealth status\r\nHousing\r\nOutreach programmes\r\nHelpseeking\r\nFunctional impairment\r\nCase management\r\nTreatment\r\nClinical outcomes\r\nLife skills training\r\nAddictions\r\nSubstance abuse\r\nHomeless people\r\nRandomized controlled trials\r\nDrug use\r\nConfidence intervals\r\nIndividualized\r\nAlcohol\r\nLife skills\r\nMental health\r\nAccident and emergency departments\r\nConditions","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa, Seattle","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691486,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34482706,"Title":"Perceptions of Health Intervene in the Relationship Between Psychiatric Symptoms and Quality of Life for Individuals in Supportive Housing","ParentTitle":"The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research","ShortTitle":"Matejkowski (2013)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:23:22.99","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T09:44:33.037","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2013","Month":"October","StandardNumber":"10943412","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"40","Pages":"469-75","Edition":"","Issue":"4","Availability":"","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11414-013-9346-y","OldItemId":"13589","Abstract":"Psychiatric symptoms and quality of life (AWOL) are important domains for mental health services and research. Findings from studies examining the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and quality of life have been mixed, prompting researchers to test moderating variables that identify for whom and under what circumstances psychiatric symptoms may or may not be particularly influential on individuals quality of life. However, in addition to knowing when or for whom symptoms influence AWOL, it is also important to understand how symptoms may be influencing quality of life. Identification of factors that intervene between psychiatric symptoms and AWOL can assist in addressing this question and inform the development of services to improve AWOL among individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). Guided by Yanos and Moos conceptual model, this study examined the effect of psychiatric symptoms on quality of life among individuals with SMI. The integrated model of functional well-being proposes that personal system factors, such as symptom severity, can directly influence social functioning, well-being, and life satisfaction. In explicating their model, the authors provide considerable evidence supporting the negative relationship between symptomatology and social functioning. However, evidence supporting a relationship between psychiatric symptoms and life satisfaction or AWOL is not provided, possibly reflecting the results of meta-analyses showing only modest relationships between the two, particularly with subjective measures of AWOL. The integrated model also hypothesizes that symptom severity can influence quality of life through its relationship with cognitive appraisals of ones illness and methods of coping with these appraisals.","Comments":"Copyright - National Council for Behavioral Health 2013 Document feature - Tables; References Last updated - 2014-08-23 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - United States--US","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Matejkowski J ; Lee S ; Henwood B ; Lukens J ; Weinstein LC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11414-013-9346-y","Keywords":"Social Services And Welfare\r\nStudies\r\nQuality of life\r\nMental health care\r\nLong term health care\r\nPsychiatry\r\nUnited States--US\r\n8320:Health care industry\r\n9190:United States\r\n9130:Experimental/theoretical\r\nHealth Surveys\r\nUnited States\r\nHumans\r\nQuestionnaires\r\nModels, Psychological\r\nAdult\r\nFemale\r\nMale\r\nSocial Adjustment\r\nAttitude to Health\r\nQuality of Life -- psychology\r\nPublic Housing\r\nHomeless Persons -- psychology\r\nMental Disorders -- psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691464,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437059,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34482858,"Title":"Moving Ahead: Evaluation of a Work-Skills Training Program for Homeless Adults","ParentTitle":"Community Mental Health Journal","ShortTitle":"Nelson (2012)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:23:23.003","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T10:09:21.017","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2012","Month":"December","StandardNumber":"00103853","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"48","Pages":"711-22","Edition":"","Issue":"","Availability":"","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10597-012-9490-5","OldItemId":"13631","Abstract":"This study examines the impact of a work-skills program grounded in an integrated services approach on both employment and related life domains among homeless individuals. Six hundred thirty-eight participants in a 14-week work-skills program at a large day center in New England completed assessments at intake between 1999 and 2007; a subsample of 333 also completed assessments at graduation from the program; a smaller subsample of 55 participants were re-assessed 6 months after graduation. These assessments measured work and related life skills, employment, housing status, general health status, substance use, self-esteem and self-efficacy, and legal involvement. Results revealed improvement in all types of work and related life skills, employment and income, and multiple other life domains from baseline to graduation and follow-up. Exploratory analyses suggested that improvements in work and related life skills were associated with improvement in self-esteem and self-efficacy, and that these improvements predicted stable housing situations at follow-up. Overall, these findings indicate that, for individuals struggling with the challenges of homelessness, completion of a work-skills program has a positive impact on skills and employment, and on a diverse set of life domains.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","Comments":"Copyright - Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012 Document feature - References Last updated - 2014-07-26 CODEN - CMHJAY","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nelson SE ; Gray HM ; Maurice IR ; Shaffer HJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s10597-012-9490-5","Keywords":"Medical Sciences--Psychiatry And Neurology\r\nHomeless people\r\nSelf esteem\r\nEmployment\r\nSkills\r\nMental health\r\nSelf Efficacy\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMale\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders -- rehabilitation\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders -- psychology\r\nRehabilitation, Vocational\r\nSelf Concept\r\nNew England\r\nQuality of Life\r\nAdult\r\nFemale\r\nProgram Evaluation\r\nDelivery of Health Care, Integrated -- organization & administration\r\nOutcome & Process Assessment (Health Care)\r\nHomeless Persons -- psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691517,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691465,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691545,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691555,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437020,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437031,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437049,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437058,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34482890,"Title":"Nursing Case Management, Peer Coaching, and Hepatitis A and B Vaccine Completion Among Homeless Men Recently Released on Parole: Randomized Clinical","ParentTitle":"Nursing Research","ShortTitle":"Nyamathi (2015)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:23:23.003","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T10:26:33.477","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2015","Month":"May","StandardNumber":"00296562","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"64","Pages":"177","Edition":"","Issue":"3","Availability":"","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418035/","OldItemId":"13994","Abstract":"Although hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are vaccine-preventable diseases, few homeless parolees coming out of prisons and jails have received the hepatitis A and B vaccination series. The study focused on completion of the HAV and HBV vaccine series among homeless men on parole. The efficacy of three levels of peer coaching (PC) and nurse-delivered interventions was compared at 12-month follow-up: (a) intensive peer coaching and nurse case management (PC-NCM); (b) intensive PC intervention condition, with minimal nurse involvement; and (c) usual care (UC) intervention condition, which included minimal PC and nurse involvement. Furthermore, we assessed predictors of vaccine completion among this targeted sample. A randomized control trial was conducted with 600 recently paroled men to assess the impact of the three intervention conditions (PC-NCM vs. PC vs. UC) on reducing drug use and recidivism; of these, 345 seronegative, vaccine-eligible subjects were included in this analysis of completion of the Twinrix HAV/HBV vaccine. Logistic regression was added to assess predictors of completion of the HAV/HBV vaccine series and chi-square analysis to compare completion rates across the three levels of intervention. Vaccine completion rate for the intervention conditions were 75.4% (PC-NCM), 71.8% (PC), and 71.9% (UC; p = .78). Predictors of vaccine noncompletion included being Asian and Pacific Islander, experiencing high levels of hostility, positive social support, reporting a history of injection drug use, being released early from California prisons, and being admitted for psychiatric illness. Predictors of vaccine series completion included reporting having six or more friends, recent cocaine use, and staying in drug treatment for at least 90 days. Findings allow greater understanding of factors affecting vaccination completion in order to design more effective programs among the high-risk population of men recently released from prison and on parole.","Comments":"Copyright - Copyright Lippincott Williams & Wilkins May-Jun 2015 Last updated - 2015-05-16 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - California","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nyamathi A ; Salem BE ; Zhang S ; Farabee D ; Hall B ; Khalilifard F ; Leake B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/NNR.0000000000000083","Keywords":"Education--Higher Education\r\nPeer tutoring\r\nHepatitis\r\nImmunization\r\nHomeless people\r\nParole & probation\r\nClinical trials\r\nIntervention\r\nCalifornia","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691492,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34482891,"Title":"Impact of an intervention for recently released homeless offenders on self-reported re-arrest at 6 and 12 months","ParentTitle":"Journal of Addictive Diseases","ShortTitle":"Nyamathi (2017)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:23:23.003","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-05-11T07:31:50.72","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2017","Month":"January","StandardNumber":"1055-0887","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"Taylor and Francis","Institution":"School of Nursing, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA ; Integrated Substance Abuse Program, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA ; Department of Sociology, San Diego State University, San Diego, California, USA ; Amistad de Los Angeles, Amity Foundation, Los Angeles, California, USA ; School of Nursing, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA","Volume":"36","Pages":"60-71","Edition":"","Issue":"1","Availability":"","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10550887.2016.1147796","OldItemId":"13932","Abstract":"A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 600 paroled men, homeless prior to incarceration, to assess varying levels of peer-coach and nurse-partnered interventions on re-arrest at 6 and 12 months.

Homeless adolescents ages 14-19 (N = 285) recruited from drop-in centers at agencies & from street intercept were randomly assigned to either a brief motivational enhancement (ME) group or 1 of 2 control groups. The 1-session motivational intervention presented personal feedback about patterns of risks related to alcohol or substance use in a style consistent with motivational interviewing. Follow-up interviews were conducted at 1 & 3 months postintervention. Youths who received the motivational intervention reported reduced illicit drug use other than marijuana at 1-month follow-up compared with youths in the control groups. Treatment effects were not found with respect to alcohol or marijuana. Post hoc analyses within the ME group suggested that those who were rated as more engaged & more likely to benefit showed greater drug use reduction than did those rated as less engaged.

Compared to stably housed individuals, homeless adults with mental disorders use hospital emergency departments and other acute health care services at a higher frequency. Housing First integrates housing and support services in a client-centred model and has been shown to reduce acute health care among homeless populations. The present analysis is based on participants enrolled in the Vancouver At Home Study (n = 297) randomised to one of three intervention arms (Housing First in a 'congregate setting', in 'scattered site' [SS] apartments in the private rental market, or to 'treatment as usual' [TAU] where individuals continue to use existing services available to homeless adults with mental illness), and incorporates linked data from a regional database representing six urban emergency departments. Compared to TAU, significantly lower numbers of emergency visits were observed during the post-randomisation period in the SS group (adjusted rate ratio 0.55 [0.35,0.86]). Our results suggest that Housing First, particularly the SS model, produces significantly lower hospital emergency department visits among homeless adults with a mental disorder. These findings demonstrate the potential effectiveness of Housing First to reduce acute health care use among homeless individuals and have implications for future health and housing policy initiatives.","Comments":"Copyright - © 2014 Taylor & Francis Last updated - 2017-07-11","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Russolillo A ; Patterson M ; McCandless L ; Moniruzzaman A ; Somers J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14616718.2014.884881","Keywords":"Housing And Urban Planning\r\nemergency departments\r\nHousing First\r\nhomelessness\r\nmental disorders\r\nDisadvantaged\r\nTreatment\r\nAdults\r\nEffectiveness\r\nServices\r\nIntervention\r\nHousing\r\nMental health services\r\nHousing policy\r\nMental illness\r\nHomeless persons\r\nHealth care services policy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"Canada","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691543,"AdditionalText":"Access to emergency department","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437013,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34483218,"Title":"Meta-Analysis of Day Treatment and Contingency-Management Dismantling Research: Birmingham Homeless Cocaine Studies (1990-2006)","ParentTitle":"Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology","ShortTitle":"Schumacher (2007)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:23:35.847","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-05-10T12:04:06.15","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2007","Month":"October","StandardNumber":"0022-006X, 0022-006X","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"75","Pages":"823-828","Edition":"","Issue":"5","Availability":"","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.75.5.823","OldItemId":"13786","Abstract":"Four successive randomized clinical trials studying contingency management (CM), involving various treatment arms of drug-abstinent housing and work therapy and day treatment (DT) with a behavioral component, were compared on common drug abstinence outcomes at 2 treatment completion points (2 and 6 months). The clinical trials were conducted from 1990 to 2006 in Birmingham, Alabama, with a total of 644 homeless persons with primary crack cocaine addiction. The meta-analysis utilized the weighted least squares approach to integrate data encompassing 9 different treatment arms to assess the effects of CM and DT (neither, DT only, CM only, and CM = DT) on a common estimate of prevalence of drug abstinence. Taken together, the results show much stronger benefits from CM = DT and from CM only than for DT alone. Throughout all of the Birmingham Homeless Cocaine Studies, the CM = DT consistently produced higher abstinence prevalence than did no CM.","Comments":"Last updated - 2017-11-28 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 5013; 4819 8016 4542; 2181 914 2094; 1690 6934; 5916 10102 6410 5964 10087 2574 3629 6582; 7455; 6559 10087 2574 3629 6582; 1955 3629 6582; 3041 3040 3049 909 10306 2923 2877; 3046 8757","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schumacher JE ; Milby JB ; Wallace D ; Meehan DC ; Kertesz S ; Vuchinich R ; Dunning J ; Usdan S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1037/0022-006X.75.5.823","Keywords":"Alabama\r\nERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nOutcomes of Treatment\r\nComparative Analysis\r\nDrug Rehabilitation\r\nLeast Squares Statistics\r\nContingency Management\r\nCocaine\r\nMeta Analysis\r\nIncidence\r\nHomeless People\r\nDrug Addiction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691460,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691496,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691508,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691524,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691557,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814919,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413935,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34483252,"Title":"Serving street-dwelling individuals with psychiatric disabilities: Outcomes of a psychiatric rehabilitation clinical trial","ParentTitle":"American Journal of Public Health","ShortTitle":"Shern (2000)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:23:35.847","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T09:56:11.91","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2000","Month":"December","StandardNumber":"00900036","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"90","Pages":"1873-8","Edition":"","Issue":"12","Availability":"","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446423/pdf/11111259.pdf","OldItemId":"13891","Abstract":"Shern et al tested a psychiatric rehabilitation approach for organizing and delivering services to street-dwelling persons with severe mental illness.

The current observational study utilized data from a national, multisite housing project to determine whether clients who receive residential treatment or transitional housing before being placed into independent housing achieve superior outcomes than clients who are immediately placed into independent housing, and whether they incur greater health care costs. A total of 709 participants (131 and 578 participants in the respective groups) were assessed every 3 months for 2 years on housing outcomes, community adjustment, work and income, mental and physical health, and health service costs. Clients who received immediate, independent housing had more days in their own place, less days incarcerated, and reported having more choice over treatment, but no differences on other clinical or community adjustment outcomes. In this observational study, there were no clinical advantages for clients who had residential treatment or transitional housing prior to entry into community housing, but they incurred higher substance abuse service costs. Studies using randomized controlled trials of these conditions are needed to establish causation.

Methods: A systematic review was conducted of research published utilising the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL and SocIndex databases from inception to March 2015. A meta-analysis was performed on studies that met the inclusion criteria, to determine if there were any significant pre- and post-intervention effects on alcohol-use. \r\rResults: Seventeen studies from three continents were included in this systematic review. A meta-analysis of pre- and post-intervention effects on alcohol use across the 17 studies found highly significant effects (p < 0.001). A smaller subset of studies (n = 10), where the same specific alcohol use outcome measurement was employed across all studies, also showed highly significant pre-post intervention effects (p < 0.001). Results indicate that a range of interventions were effective in reducing alcohol use and abuse within samples of homeless participants, although short-term effects are more apparent than longer term ones. \r\rConclusions: There is a relative paucity of research into alcohol abusing homeless adults, which has implications for evidence-based practice. This systematic meta-analytical review demonstrates that a range of alcohol abuse interventions for homeless adults produces improvements in alcohol use (p < 0.001).

Method: The AH-CS demonstration project entailed a randomized controlled trial conducted in 5 Canadian cities between 2009 and 2013. Mixed methods were used to examine the implementation of HF programs and participant outcomes, comparing 1158 people receiving HF to 990 people receiving standard care. Results: Initial research conducted in the United States shows HF to be a promising approach, yielding superior outcomes in helping people to rapidly exit homelessness and establish stable housing. Findings from the AH-CS demonstration project reveal that HF can be successfully adapted to different contexts and for different populations without losing its fidelity. People receiving HF achieved superior housing outcomes and showed more rapid improvements in community functioning and quality of life than those receiving treatment as usual. Conclusions: Knowledge translation efforts have been undertaken to disseminate the positive findings and lessons learned from the AH-CS project and to scale up the HF approach across Canada.

A research gap exists in the literature on homelessness and counseling outcomes. Accordingly, this researcher investigated the effect of outreach counseling services provided by the Community Based Counseling Program (CBCP) to homeless individuals currently living in shelters and transitional housing units. The premise of this research study was that homeless individuals who participated in outreach counseling services would report decreased problem severity on the ASI in seven domains: medical, employment, drug, alcohol, legal, social, and psychiatric. A quasi-experimental research design was used. Subjects consisted of 67 homeless men and women; 31 subjects were in the treatment group and 36 subjects were in the comparison group. The treatment group composition was mainly female while the comparison group composition was mainly male. The treatment group received a pretest and posttest ASI and outreach counseling services. The comparison group received a pretest and posttest ASI and did not receive counseling services during the study. In addition, post-intervention ASI scores were examined after demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age were taken into account. The ASI was utilized to measure change scores between the treatment and comparison groups. The dependent variables were the post-ASI difference scores in medical, employment, drug, alcohol, legal, social, and psychiatric domains. The independent variable was the counseling intervention. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results from this study indicated significant differences between the treatment and comparison groups on pretest and posttest ASI social and psychiatric scores. There were non-significant changes between the treatment and comparison groups on posttest ASI medical, alcohol, drug, and legal scores. A significant correlation between employment status and age existed, with younger clients reporting greater change post-counseling than their older counterparts. Because there were differences between the groups initially with regard to gender, it was impossible to determine whether the findings were due to treatment effects or gender differences. The researcher concluded that outreach counseling contributed to measurable change in a homeless population. It is hoped that the results of this study will stimulate further investigations in the under-researched area of homelessness and counseling outcomes.

Despite this trend, few studies have explored the effectiveness of housing interventions and housing and service interventions. The purpose of this systematic review is to appraise and synthesize evidence on effective interventions addressing family homelessness. We searched 10 major electronic databases from 2007 to 2013. Empirical studies investigating effectiveness of housing interventions and housing and service interventions for American homeless families regardless of publication status were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes included housing status, employment, parental trauma and mental health and substance use, children's behavioral and academic status, and family reunification. Study quality was appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. Six studies were included in this review. Overall, there was some postintervention improvement in housing and employment, but ongoing residential and work stability were not achieved. Methodological limitations, poor reporting quality, and inconsistent definitions across outcomes hindered between-study comparisons. Substantial limitations in research underscore the insufficiency of our current knowledge base for ending homelessness. Although many families were no longer literally homeless, long-term residential stability and employment at a livable wage were not ensured. Developing and implementing evidence-based approaches for addressing homelessness are long overdue.

This mixed-methods study investigates a mindfulness-based intervention for homeless youth, investigating (a) quantitatively—to what extent is the intervention effective in increasing youths’ mindfulness over time? and (b) qualitatively—in observing homeless youths’ participation in the mindfulness groups, what strategies appear most helpful in engaging them in this mindfulness intervention and what challenges are encountered? \r\rMethods: Using a randomized experimental design, the current study pilot tests an intensive (3 day), skill-building intervention to train homeless youth (N = 97, ages 18–21 years) to practice mindfulness and avoid risks. Youths’ mindfulness was assessed via standardized self-report instruments at baseline and post-intervention (1 week post baseline for youth in the control condition).\r\rResults: Repeated-measures ANOVA results indicate that although no effect was found on total mindfulness, a significant effect was found for mindfulness subscales.

Qualitatively, certain intervention strategies (i.e., facilitating, personal sharing, teaching, and peer activation) demonstrated notable utility in actively engaging youth in mindfulness material, whereas challenges (meeting basic needs, a fight or flight instinct, and a generalized distrust of service providers) created challenges in implementing mindfulness skills.\r\rConclusion: The intervention improved youths’ attention to internal and external stimuli yet future iterations will need to continue to modify to meet the unique needs of this population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bender K ; Begun S ; DePrince A ; Haffejee B ; Brown S ; Hathaway J ; Schau N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1086/684107","Keywords":"mindfulness intervention, homeless youth, experimental design, victimization prevention\r\n*Homeless\r\n*Intervention\r\n*Mindfulness\r\nPrevention\r\nVictimization\r\nPsychotherapy & Psychotherapeutic Counseling [3310]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691512,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691510,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691496,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691557,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437058,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34483735,"Title":"Effectiveness of the Comprehensive Approach to Rehabilitation (CARe) methodology: Design of a cluster randomized controlled trial","ParentTitle":"BMC Psychiatry","ShortTitle":"Bitter (2015)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:24:37.403","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-27T13:39:46.247","EditedBy":"Yashika Kanojia","Year":"2015","Month":"December","StandardNumber":"1471-244X ","City":"","Country":"United Kingdom","Publisher":"BioMed Central","Institution":"K Bitter, Neis A.: n.a.bitter@tilburguniversity.edu","Volume":"15","Pages":"165","Edition":"","Issue":"1","Availability":"","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-015-0564-0","OldItemId":"5323","Abstract":"Background: There is an increasing amount of evidence for the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for people with severe mental illness (SMI). In the Netherlands, a rehabilitation methodology that is well known and often applied is the Comprehensive Approach to Rehabilitation (CARe) methodology. The overall goal of the CARe methodology is to improve the client’s quality of life by supporting the client in realizing his/her goals and wishes, handling his/her vulnerability and improving the quality of his/her social environment. The methodology is strongly influenced by the concept of ‘personal recovery’ and the ‘strengths case management model’. No controlled effect studies have been conducted hitherto regarding the CARe methodology.\r\rMethods/design: This study is a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will be executed in teams from three organizations for sheltered and supported housing, which provide services to people with long-term severe mental illness. Teams in the intervention group will receive the multiple-day CARe methodology training from a specialized institute and start working according the CARe Methodology guideline. Teams in the control group will continue working in their usual way. Standardized questionnaires will be completed at baseline (T0), and 10 (T1) and 20 months (T2) post baseline. Primary outcomes are recovery, social functioning and quality of life. The model fidelity of the CARe methodology will be assessed at T1 and T2. \r\rDiscussion: This study is the first controlled effect study on the CARe methodology and one of the few RCTs on a broad rehabilitation method or strength-based approach. This study is relevant because mental health care organizations have become increasingly interested in recovery and rehabilitation-oriented care.","Comments":"Using Smart Source Parsing ArtID","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bitter NA ; Roeg DP ; van Nieuwenhuizen C ; van Weeghel Jaap ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12888-015-0564-0","Keywords":"Severe mental illness, Recovery, Recovery-oriented care, Rehabilitation, Strengths, CARe methodology\r\n*Intervention\r\n*Mental Disorders\r\n*Quality of Life\r\n*Rehabilitation\r\nRecovery (Disorders)\r\nRehabilitation [3380]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691461,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691473,"AdditionalText":"Netherlands","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691500,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691526,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437021,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437057,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437059,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413915,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437035,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34483776,"Title":"Housing first as an effective model for community stabilization among vulnerable individuals with chronic and nonchronic homelessness histories","ParentTitle":"Journal of Community Psychology","ShortTitle":"Brown (2016)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T06:24:37.403","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-04-26T15:19:42.387","EditedBy":"ashrita saran","Year":"2016","Month":"April","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"Springer Science + Business Media","Institution":"Brown, Molly M.: mbrown59@depaul.edu","Volume":"44","Pages":"384-390","Edition":"","Issue":"3","Availability":"","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.21763 ","OldItemId":"5216","Abstract":"Housing First (HF) is an effective intervention for reducing homelessness and service utilization among vulnerable adults and is most often focused on individuals experiencing chronic homelessness.

A sample of 91 HF and 91 matched usual care comparison participants were obtained from administrative records. Those in HF spent significantly less time homeless and psychiatrically hospitalized compared to usual care. Ninety percent of HF residents were housed after 1 year compared to 35% of the comparison group. Homelessness and hospitalization outcomes were unrelated to homelessness history.

Methods: We conducted a 12-month prospective cohort study of 250 older homeless adults recruited from shelters in Boston, Massachusetts, between January and June 2010. We determined housing status at follow-up, determined number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations over 12 months, and examined 4 measures of geriatric conditions at baseline and 12 months. Using multivariable regression models, we evaluated the association between obtaining housing and our outcomes of interest. Results: At 12-month follow-up, 41% of participants had obtained housing. Compared with participants who remained homeless, those with housing had fewer depressive symptoms. Other measures of health status did not differ by housing status. Participants who obtained housing had a lower rate of acute care use,with an adjusted annualized rate of acute care visits of 2.5 per year among participants who obtained housing and 5.3 per year among participants who remained homeless. Conclusions: Older homeless adults who obtained housing experienced improved depressive symptoms and reduced acute care utilization compared with those who remained homeless.

One group of youth was served in programs geared specifically towards youth aging out of foster care who were referred through a transition planning process. A second group of youth was served in similar transitional housing programs that were not exclusively for foster care alumni but instead served homeless youth in general. Comparisons between these two groups reveal that youth in the population-specific programs have less acute initial presentations than foster care alumni in homelessness intervention programs, who had faced more unemployment, school attrition, substance use, and mental health concerns prior to program admission than their peers in the programs specifically for foster care alumni. The research also shows that youth in the homelessness intervention programs had faced more instability during their years in foster care when compared to youth in the population-specific programs for foster care alumni. The research highlights the need for better understanding of the referral process for youth aging out of foster care so that transitional housing programs for young adult foster care alumni can better serve a diversity of youth with different service needs.

In particular, the effect of a family systems therapy, Ecologically Based Family Therapy (EBFT), and two individual therapies, the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), on adolescent and primary caretaker (PC) depressive symptoms were compared. Findings showed that youth's depressive symptoms were significantly reduced in each treatment to 2 years postbaseline. However, the trajectory of change differed across treatments, with adolescents receiving MET showing a more rapid reduction in depressive symptoms but a quicker increase in symptoms compared with adolescents receiving EBFT. PCs receiving EBFT showed a statistically significant decline in depressive symptoms, but this was not observed for the CRA and MET conditions. These findings can be interpreted to favor EBFT, although future research is needed to test training and implementation strategies for family systems therapies in community-based runaway shelters.

Little is known yet about whether the received shelter interventions, offered during and after women's stay, are effective. Therefore, a meta-analysis of studies was performed, testing the effectiveness of interventions administered to female IPV victims during and/or after their residence in shelters, in terms of mental health, re-abuse and social outcomes. \r\rMethods: From January 1985 through July 2011, five databases were searched for English-language articles. Original research articles evaluating the effects of interventions provided to IPV victims during and after shelter residence were identified. Hedges' g effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled if three or more studies including one outcome type were available. Results: Ten original studies, including a total number of 726 female IPV victims, were analysed. We found that shelter interventions were effective in improving mental health outcomes (g = -0.39; 95% CI: 0.24-0.54), in decreasing abuse (g = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.08-0.55) and in improving social outcomes (g = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54-0.88) in shelter-based abused women. \r\rConclusion: This analysis suggests that interventions provided during and after stay in a shelter are effective in improving mental health, abuse and social outcomes, but further research has to confirm this. Moreover, future studies should compare different type of interventions and should evaluate cost-effectiveness.

Using a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent comparison 2 group x 2 repeated measure pre- and posttest design, the outcomes of the experimental group (BFPP) were compared to the best matches for the scales that could be derived. Statistically significant positive results (p < .05) were found for all of the BFPP-measured child, parent, and homeless families' outcomes. The effect sizes of homeless families children's outcomes were all large effect sizes over d = .90 and three to four times larger than the effect size of the SFP3-5 national norms, namely depression (d = 0.94 vs. 0.19), overt aggression (d = 0.90 vs. 0.24), and social behavior (d = 0.98 vs. 0.34). The BFPP parenting scales compared to SFP norms were smaller in effect sizes than the SFP norms, including positive parenting (d = 0.66 vs. 0.92), parental supervision (d = 0.54 vs. 0.88), parenting efficacy (d = 0.82 vs. 0.85), parental empathy (d = 0.61 vs. 0.89), parenting skills (d = 0.73 vs. 0.94), and parental stress (d = 0.81 vs. 0.75). For the one family cohesion scale, the effect sizes for BFPP was also smaller than the SFP Delaware norms (d = 0.56 vs. 0.93). Statistically significant positive results (p < .05) from the BFPP were found for all of the child's behavioral outcomes with effect sizes ranging from medium to large including the number of days and duration child engaged in physical and sedentary activities (d = 0.74), (d = 0.65), and (d = 0.8), the number and amount of eating fruit and vegetables (d = 0.56) and (d = 0.87). The new BFPP that included the two added components of physical activities and the increase of fruit and vegetable consumption proved an effective program due to the large significant improvements in the parent, family, and child's outcomes.

Few data exist, however, to substantiate the implications of chronic homelessness for major health outcomes. Objectives: Using data from a 2-year cohort of addicted persons, we tested whether changes in mental and physical health-related quality of life (HRQOL) differed according to homeless chronicity. \r\rMethods: Using self-reported homelessness, we classified subjects as chronically homeless (CH; n = 60), transitionally homeless (TRANS; n = 108), or as housed comparison subjects (HSD; n = 106). The Short Form-36 Health Survey, administered at baseline and 2 follow-ups over a period of 2 years, provided a Mental Component Summary (MCS) and a Physical Component Summary (PCS) for HRQOL. Mixed model linear regression was used to test the association between housing status, MCS, and PCS. Additional models assessed whether medical, psychiatric, addiction, and social support measures could account for HRQOL differences. Results: All subjects had low MCS scores at study entry (mean, 31.2; SD, 12.6). However, there was a significant housing status-by-time interaction (P = 0.01). At final follow-up, CH and TRANS subjects had lower adjusted MCS scores than HSD subjects (33.4, 38.8, and 43.7 for the 3 groups, respectively; all P <= 0.01). By contrast, housing status and PCS were not significantly associated (P = 0.19). Medical, psychiatric, addiction, and social support variables had significant associations with MCS, and their inclusion in the regression reduced the apparent effect of housing status on MCS. \r\rConclusions: Chronic homelessness was associated with especially poor mental but not physical HRQOL over time. These findings reinforce a new typology of homelessness.

In many of these communities, addiction treatment programs remain the default point of entry to housing and services. This study examined the percentage of cocaine-using homeless persons (all with psychiatric distress) attaining stable housing and employment 12 months after entering a randomized trial of intensive behavioral day treatment, plus one of the following for 6 months: no housing; housing contingent on drug abstinence; housing not contingent on abstinence. Of 138 participants, the percentages with stable housing and employment at 12 months were 34.1 and 33.3%, respectively. Analyses suggested superior outcomes in trial arms that offered housing as part of the behavioral treatment. The majority of participants, however, did not achieve housing or employment, in part because of the limited capacity of the local housing programs to accommodate persons who had not achieved perfect abstinence. The findings demonstrate a helpful role for addiction treatment and suggest the need for services to support housing of persons who reduce but do not eliminate all substance use.

This study uses a randomized control design to examine the effects of scatter-site Housing First on substance use outcomes in a large urban centre.\r\rMethods\rSubstance use outcomes were compared between a Housing First intervention and treatment as usual group in a sample of 575 individuals experiencing homelessness and mental illness, with or without a co-occurring substance use problem, in the At Home/Chez Soi trial in Toronto, Canada. Generalized linear models were used to compare study arms with respect to change in substance use outcomes over time (baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month).\r\rResults\rAt 24 months, participants in the Housing First intervention had significantly greater reductions in number of days experiencing alcohol problems and amount of money spent on alcohol than participants in the Treatment as Usual group.

Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat three-level mixed-effects models.Results: Women in the CTI group had significant fewer symptoms of post-traumatic stress (secondary outcome) (adjusted mean difference - 7.27, 95% CI - 14.31 to - 0.22) and a significant fourfold reduction in unmet care needs (intermediate outcome) (95% CI 0.06-0.94) compared to women in the care-as-usual group.

Intensity reflected on the amount of structure and degree of clients' independence. The outcome variable was tenure in housing. Cox stepwise regression was used to calculate risk ratios of becoming discontinuously housed. 30% of the sample were initially placed in high-intensity settings (HIS), 18% in moderate-intensity settings (MIS), and 52% in low-intensity settings. Those in HIS tended to be younger, to be referred from hospitals, and to have a history or diagnosis of substance abuse. Individuals in MIS were more likely to be female and were least likely to have substance abuse problems. Individuals in low-intensity settings were more likely to be referred by municipal shelters and to have lived in municipal shelters for 4 or more mo. After 1, 2, and 5 yrs, 75%, 64%, and 50%, respectively, of the sample were continuously housed.

In the United States, it is estimated that over a one-year period approximately 700,000 to 2 million people experience homelessness. In addition to the basic needs of shelter, food, and clothing, there are particular psychological barriers to consider for this population. One such obstacle includes the tendency to ruminate over interpersonal offenses. Similar to other populations in crisis, specific strategies and interventions are needed to enhance therapeutic movement and build client resources. The construct of forgiveness has been shown to improve psychological and physical wellbeing, and enhance social functioning. However, homeless individuals may have low levels of forgiveness due in part to the nature of their social environment. The environment of the homeless shelter is one in which interpersonal transgressions are commonplace. When individuals do not directly address the negative emotions resulting from such transgressions, rumination is likely to be maintained. Capacity for forgiveness is lowered as repeated transgressions foster prolonged rumination. In addition, it is likely that many homeless individuals continue to ruminate over transgressions committed against them in their past. To address the psychological distress resulting from both past and current interpersonal transgressions, it was hypothesized that a forgiveness intervention would provide a plausible direction for treatment with this population, as participants would have the opportunity to remediate emotional hurt, improve social connectedness, and learn a new coping strategy for handling future interpersonal transgressions. A group forgiveness intervention with adult male homeless individuals was conducted to investigate if participation would result in decreased rumination, increased forgiveness (offensespecific and likelihood to forgive in the future), and increased social connectedness. Participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or waitlist control group. Treatment participants attended 4, 2-hour group meetings over the course of a 10-day period for a total of 8 treatment hours. The forgiveness intervention was based on Enright's (2001) model as outlined in Forgiveness is a Choice: A Step-by-Step Process for Resolving Anger and Restoring Hope. A doubly multivariate repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess within-group treatment gains from pre to posttest and pretest to one-month follow-up across all 30 treatment participants. Multiple Analyses of Covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted to assess between-group differences in posttest scores between the initial 16 treatment participants and 16 waitlist controls, while controlling for pretest score on the various measures. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for inflated alpha level. Results indicated statistically significant increases in offense-specific forgiveness and likelihood to forgive in the future for the treatment participants when compared to the waitlist control group at posttest. In addition, when comparing the treatment participants' scores from pre to posttest and from pretest to one-month follow-up, statistically significant decreases in rumination, and statistically significant increases in offense-specific forgiveness and likelihood to forgive in the future were found. From pretest to one-month follow-up, statistically significant increases were found for social connectedness.

In the United States, homelessness is a problem with multiple and complex causes that include mental illness and the effects of physical, economic, and social conditions such as extreme poverty, exposure to the elements, mental and substance abuse disorders, malnutrition, and victimization. Transitional housing is a temporary option offered as a response to homelessness, recognizing that if individuals are provided with shelter, they may be supported in their attempt to achieve self-sufficiency. There is some evidence that supports the benefits of federally funded transitional housing programs, but to date, few studies have been conducted on faith-based transitional housing programs. These programs often suffer from limited resources and rely instead on providing a faith-based continuum of care to help the homeless achieve independence. This mixed-methods study was designed to examine how one faith-based transitional housing program facility located in Southern California was able to change the attitudes and behaviors of homeless men regarding their lives and their propensity to remain homeless. A pre- and post-survey were administered to 108 homeless men. The men were also observed as they participated in the program activities over a 9 month period. Ten interviews were conducted with a subgroup of those surveyed to explore from their perspective how this faith-based intervention approach supported and/or challenged their recovery. Findings suggest that the attitudes and behaviors of the homeless men who participated in the program were changed, especially those who were in the program for 9 months or more. The majority of the men attributed the change to the faith-based focus of the program. Differences emerged, however, between the men who were in the program for 9 months or more versus those in the program less than 9 months. Nine-month or more participants claimed that they were willing to \"surrender\" their old ways of thinking and living. In contrast, participants less than 9 months were unable to relinquish their former lifestyle. This failure was related to individual pride and/or challenges with addictions. This study provides important lessons for faith-based organizations aiming to develop specific strategies of care that support the needs of homeless men.

To reduce the likelihood of recidivism, Washington State implemented the Reentry Housing Pilot Program (RHPP) to provide housing assistance for high risk/high need offenders leaving prison without a viable place to live. This study provides a longitudinal (2008-2011), multisite outcome evaluation that considers how ex-offenders in the RHPP program (n = 208), who were provided housing and wraparound services, compared with similar offenders released with an elevated risk of homelessness while being traditionally supervised (n = 208). Findings show that the RHPP program was successful in significantly reducing new convictions and readmission to prison for new crimes, but had no significant effect on revocations. In addition, results showed that periods of homelessness significantly elevated the risk of recidivism for new convictions, revocations, and readmission to prison. The authors recommend that subsidized housing for high risk offenders become a central part of coordinated responses to reentry.

Overall costs of services use by homeless people can be considerable, suggesting the potential for significant cost offsets with HF programs. Our purpose was to provide an updated literature review, from 2007 to the present, focusing specifically on the cost offsets of HF programs. \r\rMethod: A systematic review was performed on MEDLINE and PsycINFO as well as Google and the Homeless Hub for grey literature. Study characteristics and key findings were extracted from identified studies. Where available, impact on service cost associated with HF (increase or decrease) and net impact on overall costs, taking into account the cost of HF intervention, were noted \r\rResults: Twelve published studies (4 randomized studies and 8 quasi-experimental) and 22 unpublished studies were retained. Shelter and emergency department costs decreased with HF, while impacts on hospitalization and justice costs are more ambiguous. Studies using a pre-post design reported a net decrease in overall costs with HF. In contrast, experimental studies reported a net increase in overall costs with HF. \r\rConclusions: While our review casts doubt on whether HF programs can be expected to pay for themselves, the certainty of significant cost offsets, combined with their benefits for participants, means that they represent a more efficient allocation of resources than traditional services.

Mindfulness based interventions have been shown to have positive impacts on anxiety, depression and addiction in various populations. Mixed methods explored the impact of a mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention for 12 homeless men. Quantitative measures of anxiety, depression, impulsivity and emotional reactivity were completed pre and post intervention, and participants were interviewed about their experiences of MBSR. Statistically significant changes in anxiety, depression, emotional reactivity and impulsivity were found. The qualitative data highlighted how mindfulness skills can easily be taught to this population, and through the use of these skills, participants were able to develop enhanced coping skills, mindful traits, well-being and an improved capacity to deal with their mental health and addiction issues. This study gives support to the promising potential of mindfulness interventions being implemented by mental health care professionals with homeless service users.

The present study examined the effect of direct and indirect ratings of working alliance on concurrent and longer-term health outcomes, and measured the moderating impact of racial and age matching between clients and their case managers on the effect of working alliance. This study represented a secondary data analysis of a case management intervention for homeless mothers with addictive disorders. Cases were selected for this investigation if they reported having a case manager at a baseline assessment and if demographic characteristics had been collected on their primary case manager (n=90). Working alliance ratings, demographics, physical health, mental health, and substance-use outcomes were collected at baseline, as well as 3-month, 9-month, and 15-month interviews. Relationships between baseline variables and the working alliances were analyzed, as well as the effect of the working alliance on health outcomes over time. Finally, the moderating effect of racial and age matching was considered. The overall effect of working alliance by itself on subsequent physical and mental health and substance use outcomes was negligible. However, the interaction between age and racial matching with working alliance appeared to influence clients' health outcomes over time. In racially matched dyads, high direct working alliance was associated with self-reported improvements in overall physical health as well as for more specific components of physical health (i.e., role limitations and vitality). When clients and case managers were age-matched, low indirect working alliance ratings were associated with better substance abuse outcomes, and when racially matched, better social functioning. This contrast between the direct and indirect measures as well as the key importance of the interaction effects, indicate a need to examine working alliance ratings in the context of the role of race and age matching between clients and case managers for women who have physical health, mental health, or substance use concerns. These findings have important implications for programs seeking to help homeless mothers with addictive disorders to help manage and improve their physical health, mental health, and substance use.

A total of 37 therapeutic community program participants at Austin Street Centre (ASC), a homeless shelter in Dallas, Texas, were compared across time to an approximately matched, no-treatment comparison group (N = 37), who utilized only basic shelter services. The groups were evaluated at baseline and compared at six-week and three-month follow-ups. Due to greater ease in tracking program participants, the therapeutic community program group (TCPG) was followed over a longer period of time, with additional evaluations occurring at six months and one year. All participants were compared on psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, and substance abuse, whereas an additional measure was administered to the TCPG to evaluate their work performance within the program. It was expected that the TCPG would show significant change across time and when compared to the CG on all outcome measures. As predicted, the TCPG demonstrated significant within-group and between-group improvements in overall distress, psychiatric symptoms, and substance abuse. Improvements in social functioning were exhibited in the TCPG at later follow-up time periods, when participants received treatment for a longer period of time. The CG did not evidence significant improvement in any of the aforementioned domains. Given the high attrition rate among the homeless, retention rates and outcome were also investigated. The retention rate was higher in the TCPG at three-month follow-up when compared to the CG. Analysis of outcome among drop-outs revealed that a greater number of the TCPG participants experienced a positive outcome upon departure from the program than those who dropped out of the CG. Future research will need to determine what factors contribute to greater retention in the therapeutic community. With greater retention and completion of the therapeutic community program, it is likely that more homeless individuals would experience the full range of benefits that a comprehensive treatment modality such as a therapeutic community can offer. These benefits range from more immediate symptom reduction to longer term improvements in social/occupational functioning that can herald a more fulfilling, affiliated life in the larger community.

Many determinants are decided after birth, depending on the surrounding physical, psychological and social environment that the child enters. Elements such as socioeconomic status, marital status, race, education level and access to healthcare greatly affect a mother's health literacy, and, thus, her ability to adequately care for her child(ren). This project examines the impact of maternal health literacy training on the behavior and knowledge of mothers who have been homeless, and on their children. A group of these mothers was given a six hour maternal health literacy training, and a survey was administered before and after the training. Due to the small sample size and the transient population, there is a chance that the data may not be robust enough to substantiate our expectation to establish short-term benefits of the training, so an additional questionnaire was given to several women who were still in the program a few months after the training. The anticipation is that enough data will prove the benefits of the maternal health literacy training in order to move forward with the implementation of a more consistent health literacy training program for this population of women wherever they may be.

We hypothesized that subjective QoL would improve over time among participants assigned to supported housing as compared to TAU, regardless of the type of supported housing received or participants' level of need. Methods: Participants (n = 497) were stratified by level of need (\"high\" or \"moderate\") and randomly assigned to Housing First (HF) in scattered-site apartments, HF in a congregate setting (high needs only), or TAU. Linear mixed-effects regression was used to model the association between study arm and self-reported QoL at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-baseline by need level. Results: Based on the adjusted overall score on the QoL measure, participants randomized to HF reported significantly greater overall QoL as compared to TAU, regardless of need level or type of supported housing at both 6 and 12 months post-baseline. Scores on the safety and living situation subscales were significantly greater for both high and moderate need participants assigned to supported housing regardless of type at both 6 and 12 months post-baseline as compared to TAU. Conclusions: Despite multiple health and social challenges faced by homeless individuals with mental illness, HF in both scattered-site and congregate models results in significantly greater perceived QoL as compared to individuals who do not receive HF even after a relatively short period of time.

No experimental trials have investigated the impact of Housing First on adherence among patients with schizophrenia. We investigated whether Housing First in congregate and scattered-site configurations resulted in superior adherence compared to usual care. Adult participants (n = 165) met criteria for homelessness, schizophrenia, and initiation of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy prior to recruitment to an unblinded, 3-arm randomized controlled trial in Vancouver, Canada. Randomization arms were: congregate Housing First (CHF) with on-site supports (including physician and pharmacy services); scattered-site Housing First (SHF) with Assertive Community Treatment; or treatment as usual (TAU) consisting of existing services. Participants were followed for an average of 2.6 years. Adherence to antipsychotic medication was measured using the medication possession ratio (MPR), and 1-way ANOVA was used to compare outcomes between the 3 conditions. Data were drawn from comprehensive pharmacy records. Prior to randomization, mean MPR among participants was very low (0.44-0.48). Mean MPR in the follow-up period was significantly different between study arms (P < .001) and approached the guideline threshold of 0.80 in SHF. Compared to TAU, antipsychotic adherence was significantly higher in SHF but not in CHF. The results demonstrate that further implementation of SHF is indicated among homeless people with schizophrenia, and that urgent action is needed to address very low levels of antipsychotic adherence in this population.

Building on the usefulness of long-acting medication and our work in psychosocial interventions to enhance adherence, we conducted a prospective uncontrolled trial of customized adherence enhancement (CAE) plus long-acting injectable antipsychotic (LAI) using haloperidol decanoate in 30 homeless or recently homeless individuals with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Method: Participants received monthly CAE and LAI (CAE-L) for 6 months. Primary outcomes were adherence, as measured by the Tablets Routine Questionnaire, and housing status. Secondary outcomes included psychiatric symptoms, functioning, side effects, and hospitalizations. The study was conducted from July 2010 to December 2012. Results:The mean age of participants was 41.8 years (SD = 8.6); they were mainly minorities (90%, n = 27 African- American) and mainly single/never married (70%, n = 21). Most (97%, n = 29) had past or current substance abuse and had been incarcerated (97%, n = 29).Ten individuals (33%) terminated the study prematurely. CAE-L was associated with good adherence to LAI (at 6 months, 76%) and dramatic improvement in oral medication adherence, which changed from missing 46% of medication at study enrollment to missing only 10% at study end (P = .03). There were significant improvements in psychiatric symptoms (P < .001) and functioning (P < .001). Akathisia was a major side effect with LAI. Conclusions: While interpretation of findings must be tempered by the methodological limitations, CAE-L appears to be associated with improved adherence, symptoms, and functioning in homeless or recently homeless individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Additional research is needed on effective and practical approaches to improving health outcomes for homeless people with serious mental illness.

Methods: A quasi-experimental 18-month follow-up study was conducted with 157 persons newly entering supported housing and community residences. The housing models accepted persons with similar illness characteristics and homelessness histories, so that the inability to randomly assign tenants to housing types could be compensated for by propensity scoring methods. Tenure in housing was examined by using survival models. Analyses of other outcomes used hierarchical linear and regression models in both intent-to-treat (N=139) and true-stayer (N=80) analyses. Results: Tenure in housing did not differ by housing type. Substantial proportions of tenants in both models remained housed during the follow-up period. Tenants in supported housing reported greater housing satisfaction in terms of autonomy and economic viability. Over time some tenants in supported housing reported greater feelings of isolation. Independent of housing type, symptoms of depression or anxiety at housing entry increased the risk of poorer outcomes. Conclusions: The models of supported housing were viable portals of entry into community housing for homeless persons, even for consumers with characteristics indicating that they would have been more likely to be placed in community residences. The results suggest that greater clinical attention should be paid to persons who exhibit depression or anxiety when entering housing.

Methods: We used a 1-year pre-post comparison group design. The 29 participants and 31 comparison group members were adults who were homeless with inpatient claims of at least $10 000 or at least 60 sobering \"sleep off\" center contacts in the prior year. Results: Participants showed a significantly greater reduction in emergency department and sobering center use relative to the comparison group. At a trend level, participants had greater reductions in hospital admissions and jail bookings. Reductions in estimated costs for participants and comparison group members were $62 504 and $25 925 per person per year-a difference of $36 579, far outweighing program costs of $18 600 per person per year. Conclusions: HF participants showed striking reductions in acute-care use relative to the comparison group, demonstrating that HF can be a successful model for people with complex medical conditions and high prior acute-care use. Despite notable methodological limitations, these findings could be used to inform a larger multisite study that would establish greater generalizability.

In Los Angeles County a large proportion of those funds is used to fund Full Service Partnerships, intensive outpatient programs that are based on the Assertive Community Treatment model and provide services to adults with severe mental illness and extensive past-year histories of homelessness, incarceration, or inpatient or emergency psychiatric treatment, or who would be at risk of these outcomes if not for their family's support. These programs provide intensive care to a relatively small number of clients, while existing programs continue to suffer from budget shortfalls. This dissertation follows clients from six Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health clinics to evaluate the effect of FSP enrollment on public mental health services costs and health utility (preference-weighted health-related quality of life outcomes), using a matched comparison sample of clients receiving Usual Care services from these clinics and data from the year prior to admission and the first year following admission. Adjusted difference-in-difference analyses find that, in terms of public mental health services costs, FSP programs are considerably more expensive than Usual Care for comparable clients with severe mental illness. FSP clients receive much more intensive outpatient services than Usual Care clients, and, relative to Usual Care clients, the greater increase in outpatient costs relative to the pre-enrollment year is not offset by reductions in intensive utilization like emergency or inpatient services. These analyses do not include data on jail mental health or pharmacy costs; however, while we hypothesize that jail mental health costs will decline for FSP clients relative to Usual Care, these decreases are not expected to be large enough to offset the increased outpatient costs of FSP treatment relative to Usual Care. Analysis of health utility outcomes finds that FSP clients may have slightly higher health utility one year after admission than clients enrolled in Usual Care. However, unless higher benefits or lower costs are observed when a longer follow-up timeline is used, this difference in health utility is too small to justify the higher cost of FSP programs from the perspective of the public mental health system.

Despite its promise as an alternative to traditional sequential residential rehabilitation programs, supported housing has not been evaluated to an extent that supports firm conclusions concerning the efficacy of specific program elements. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on supported housing and similarly labeled programs, to determine the degree of clarity in the supported housing model and the degree of fidelity to that model within the empirical literature, and to determine whether lack of clarity or fidelity are barriers to widespread, systematic program implementation and evaluation. We encountered a number of limitations in the literature, including conflicting use of program labels, inconsistent definitions of supported housing and its elements, and use of inadequate measurement indices in assessing adherence to program elements. Our findings suggest that greater model clarity, better specification of model elements, and greater standardization in measurement of program dimensions would aid in supported housing program implementation and evaluation. We present a number of recommendations for the field and suggestions for future research.

Linked to social conditioning, factors associated with homeless are addressed through preventative and intervention measures. The fight to solve homelessness appears to be never ending. Utilizing a quantitative quasi experimental design research method (e.g., data collection, record review, Quality of Service and Program Effectiveness Likert-like scale, and convenience sampling), this research study examined the effectiveness of the HOPE Program in combating homelessness among individuals enrolled in the program versus those who were receiving alternative services from the Advocacy and Benefits Program but are not participating in the HOPE Program. The focus of this study were homeless interventions and preventative measures and the goal was to determine whether there were a significant relationship between interventions utilized with participants in both programs and a reduction in homelessness or at risk for homelessness. Results indicated that a significant relationship did exist between the reduction in homelessness and at risk for homelessness and program interventions among programs' participants.

However, studies of housing interventions rarely report HQ. The purpose of this study was to describe HQ in a multi-site randomized controlled trial of Housing First (HF) in five Canadian cities and to examine possible differences by treatment group (HF recipients and treatment-as-usual (TAU) participants who were able to find housing through other programs or on their own). We also examined the association between HQ and the primary trial outcome: housing stability. The performance of a new multi-dimensional standardized observer-rated housing quality scale (the OHQS) in a relatively large cross-site sample was also of interest. HQ was rated by trained research assistants for 204 HF participants and 228 TAU participants using the OHQS. General linear regression models were used to examine unit/building quality scores by group and site adjusting for other group differences, and as a predictor of housing stability outcomes after 24 months of follow-up. The OHQS was found to have good reliability and validity, but because most of the neighborhood subscale items were negatively correlated with the overall scale, only unit and building items were included in the total HQ score (possible scores ranging from 13.5 to 135). Unit/building HQ was significantly better for the HF group overall (91.2 (95% CI = 89.6-92.9) vs. 88.3 (95% CI = 86.1-90.5); p = .036), and in one site. HQ in the TAU group was much more variable than the HF group overall (W(mean) = 24.7; p < .001) and in four of five sites. Unit/building HQ scores were positively associated with housing stability: (73.4 (95 % CI 68.3-78.5) for those housed none of the time; 91.1 (95% CI 89.2-93.0) for those housed some of the time; and 93.1 (95% CI 91.4-94.9)) for those housed all of the time (F = 43.9 p < .001). This association held after adjusting for site, housing characteristics, participant ethnocultural status, community functioning, and social support. This study demonstrates that HQ can be as good or better, and less variable, in HF programs in Canada that systematically and predominantly source housing stock from the private sector compared to housing procured outside of an HF program. HQ is also an important predictor of housing stability outcomes.","Comments":"Adair, Carol E. Kopp, Brianna Distasio, Jino Hwang, Stephen W.

The study took place in 2007 and involved local prisons in London and Manchester.\r\rMethods. A pilot randomised controlled trial in which CTI was compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU). Results. Sixty prisoners were randomised in the trial, with outcome measures completed on 23. A higher proportion of prisoners in CTI group were in contact with services at follow-up than those receiving TAU. CTI prisoners were significantly more likely to be receiving medication, and be registered with a General Practitioner (GP) than those in the TAU group. \r\rConclusions. Continuity of care for prisoners with severe mental illness can be improved by working with them to identify their needs prior to release, and by assisting them to engage effectively to the necessary agencies in the community.","Comments":"Jarrett, M.

Forty-two per cent of participants reported 1 or more suicide attempts, 85.4% fell in a high range of psychological distress, and key indicators of risk included an earlier age of the first episode of homelessness, female gender, and identifying as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and 2 spirit [LGBTQ2S]). \r\rConclusions: This study provides clear and compelling evidence of a need for mental health support for these youth, particularly LGBTQ2S youth and female youth. The mental health concerns observed here, however, must be considered in the light of the tremendous adversity in all social determinants faced by these youth, with population-level interventions best leveraged in prevention and rapid response.","Comments":"Kidd, Sean A.

Case management ( CM) coordinates care for persons with complex health care needs. It is not known whether CM is effective at improving biological outcomes among homeless and marginally housed persons with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) infection. Our goal was to determine whether CM is associated with reduced acute medical care use and improved biological outcomes in homeless and marginally housed persons with HIV infection. \r\rMethods. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study in a probability-based community sample of HIV-infected homeless and marginally housed adults in San Francisco, California. The primary independent variable was CM, defined as none or rare ( any CM in <= 25% of quarters in the study), moderate ( > 25% but <= 75%), or consistent ( > 75%). The dependent variables were 3 self-reported health service use measures ( receipt of primary care, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and antiretroviral therapy adherence) and 2 biological measures ( increase in CD4(+) cell count of >= 50% and geometric mean HIV load of <= 400 copies/mL). \r\rResults. In multivariate models, CM was not associated with increased primary care, emergency department use, or hospitalization. Moderate CM, compared with no or rare CM, was associated with an adjusted beta coefficient of 0.13 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.02 - 0.25) for improved antiretroviral adherence. Consistent CM ( adjusted odds ratio [ AOR], 10.7; 95% CI, 2.3 - 49.6) and moderate CM ( AOR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.3 - 33.0) were both associated with >= 50% improvements in CD4+ cell count. CM was not associated with geometric HIV load < 400 copies/mL when antiretroviral therapy adherence was included in the model. Study limitations include a lack of randomization. \r\rConclusion. CM may be a successful method to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and biological outcomes among HIV-infected homeless and marginally housed adults.","Comments":"Kushel, MB Colfax, G Ragland, K Heineman, A Palacio, H Bangsberg, DR","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kushel MB ; Colfax G ; Ragland K ; Heineman A ; Palacio H ; Bangsberg DR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1086/505212","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4731285,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691535,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691543,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416401,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437043,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437046,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34487067,"Title":"Intergovernmental Alignment, Program Effectiveness, and US Homelessness Policy","ParentTitle":"Publius-the Journal of Federalism","ShortTitle":"Lee (2017)","DateCreated":"2018-03-13T08:36:03.457","CreatedBy":"ashrita saran","DateEdited":"2018-11-27T13:06:36.237","EditedBy":"Ann Jillian Adona","Year":"2017","Month":"July","StandardNumber":"0048-5950","City":"","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"47","Pages":"622-647","Edition":"","Issue":"4","Availability":"","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/publius/article-abstract/47/4/622/3958333","OldItemId":"7854","Abstract":"In the U.S. intergovernmental system, state governments can voluntarily and strategically align with federal government strategies and objectives. This study examines the effect of intergovernmental alignment on federal homelessness program outcomes. In 2010, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness started the first national-level comprehensive strategic plan on homelessness: Opening Doors. The Opening Doors plan highlights intergovernmental partnerships as effective tools to implement federal homeless programs to different levels of governments in order to achieve federal outcomes. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we find that county governments that align their homelessness program with the federal and state government have better program outcomes than those that do not align intergovernmentally. Our findings help to expand our understanding of intergovernmental mechanisms as effective policy tools to achieve federal program outcomes at the local level in the absence of financial inducements or legal mandates.","Comments":"-population not clear\r-intervention: M2 (housing/planning)\r-outcome not clear\r\r\rLee, David McGuire, Michael","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lee D ; McGuire M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/publius/pjx044","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691469,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"usa","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691494,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691502,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691480,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814916,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413925,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5416399,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437023,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]},{"ItemId":34487080,"Title":"Does One Size Fit All?

The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 44 unique housing alternatives described in 30 studies, which they categorized as residential care and treatment, residential continuum, permanent supported housing, and nonmodel housing. Outcomes examined included housing stability, symptoms, hospitalization, and satisfaction.\r\rMethods: Outcome scores were converted to effect size measures appropriate to the data. Effect sizes were combined to estimate random effects for housing models, which were then compared. Results: All models achieved significantly greater housing stability than nonmodel housing. This effect was greatest for permanent supported housing (effect size=.63, p<.05). No differences between housing models were significant. For reduction of psychiatric symptoms, only residential care and treatment differed from nonmodel housing (effect size=.65, p<.05). For hospitalization reduction, both residential care and treatment and permanent supported housing differed from nonmodel housing (p<.05). Permanent supported housing achieved the highest effect size (. 73) for satisfaction and differed from nonmodel housing and residential care and treatment (p<.001 and p<.05, respectively). \r\rConclusions: The meta-analysis provides quantitative evidence that compared with nonmodel housing, housing models contribute to stable housing and other favorable outcomes. The findings also support the theory that different housing models achieve different outcomes for different subgroups. Data were not sufficient to fully answer questions designed to enable program planners and providers to better meet consumers' needs. It is important to answer these questions with research that uses common measures and adheres to scientific conventions.

However, endemic homelessness persists. Multidisciplinary outreach teams that include nursing, social and psychiatric services allow for integrative strategies to engage and support clients on their housing trajectory. The following retrospective review focused on the identification of demographic, clinical, and service characteristics that predicted the obtainment of housing, and explored the role of psychiatric hospitalization as an intervention, not an outcome measure, in contrast to previous studies. These have rarely focused on street homelessness. \r\rMethod: A retrospective chart review of 85 homeless, primarily rough-sleeping, clients was conducted to determine housing outcomes and the factors associated with obtaining housing through care provided by a psychiatric street outreach team in Toronto, Canada. Demographics, homelessness duration, diagnosis, hospitalization and housing status were tracked during team involvement. \r\rResults: Overall, 46% (36/79) were housed during the study term. Securing housing at the end of treatment/data collection was significantly enhanced by hospitalization (OR=9.04, 95% CI [2.43, 33.59]). It was significantly diminished by psychosis (OR=0.22, 95% CI [0.05, 0.95]) and prior homelessness >36months (OR=0.10, 95% CI [0.02, 0.50]). Twenty-three of 31 (74%) hospitalized clients with psychosis were subsequently housed, compared to 4 of 30 (13%) not hospitalized (Fisher's exact, P<.001). \r\rDiscussion: Multidisciplinary street outreach teams successfully house long-standing homeless clients (>12months without a permanent address) with serious mental illness and/or substance abuse. Hospitalization can be utilized as a complimentary intervention, particularly for those with psychosis, in the continuum of housing first initiatives, and can contribute to securing housing for those with persistent psychotic disorders. Implications for nursing practice Community mental health nurses are uniquely positioned to translate care between hospital and community settings, ensuring timely assessment, intervention and treatment of clients who are historically difficult to engage.","Comments":"Lettner, B.

We measured housing stability using sequence analysis and assessed whether a supportive housing program in New York, New York, was effective in improving housing stability and reducing STIs among former foster youth. Matched administrative records identified 895 former foster youth who were eligible for the housing program during 2007-2010. The main outcomes included housing stability (as determined from episodes of homelessness, incarceration, hospitalization, and residence in supportive housing) and diagnosed STI case rates per 1,000 person-years during the 2 years after baseline. Marginal structural models were used to assess impacts of the program on these outcomes. Three housing stability patterns (unstable housing, stable housing, and rare institutional dwelling patterns) were identified. The housing program was positively associated with a pattern of stable housing (odds ratio = 4.4, 95% confidence interval: 2.9, 6.8), and negatively associated with diagnosed STI rates (relative risk = 0.3, 95% confidence interval: 0.2, 0.7).

Objective To assess the effectiveness of a case management and housing program in reducing use of urgent medical services among homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized controlled trial conducted at a public teaching hospital and a private, nonprofit hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Participants were 407 social worker-referred homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses (89% of referrals) from September 2003 until May 2006, with follow-up through December 2007. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Intervention Housing offered as transitional housing after hospitalization discharge, followed by placement in long-term housing; case management offered on-site at primary study sites, transitional housing, and stable housing sites. Usual care participants received standard discharge planning from hospital social workers. Main Outcome Measures Hospitalizations, hospital days, and emergency department visits measured using electronic surveillance, medical records, and interviews. Models were adjusted for baseline differences in demographics, insurance status, prior hospitalization or emergency department visit, human immunodeficiency virus infection, current use of alcohol or other drugs, mental health symptoms, and other factors. Results The analytic sample (n=405 [n=201 for the intervention group, n=204 for the usual care group]) was 78% men and 78% African American, with a median duration of homelessness of 30 months. After 18 months, 73% of participants had at least 1 hospitalization or emergency department visit. Compared with the usual care group, the intervention group had unadjusted annualized mean reductions of 0.5 hospitalizations (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.2 to 0.2), 2.7 fewer hospital days (95% CI, -5.6 to 0.2), and 1.2 fewer emergency department visits (95% CI, -2.4 to 0.03). Adjusting for baseline covariates, compared with the usual care group, the intervention group had a relative reduction of 29% in hospitalizations (95% CI, 10% to 44%), 29% in hospital days (95% CI, 8% to 45%), and 24% in emergency department visits (95% CI, 3% to 40%). Conclusion After adjustment, offering housing and case management to a population of homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses resulted in fewer hospital days and emergency department visits, compared with usual care.

Adapted from an empirically informed intervention to prevent recurrent homelessness among individuals, the Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) supports mothers with children for a 9-month period as they move from homeless shelters into affordable housing. The case management team uses a structured intervention to encourage mothers to create and maintain necessary connections in the community for key family supports. Method: We use a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (N = 210) to test whether homeless mothers referred to FCTI experience greater declines in psychopathology compared with those receiving homeless services-as-usual. All families receive access to affordable housing. Hierarchical linear models examine changes in symptomatology at shelter entry and 3, 9, and 15 months later. Results: Results suggest all homeless mothers report significant and clinically meaningful declines in mental distress over time, regardless of intervention condition. Treatment effects do not vary by prior homelessness experiences or receipt of mental health services. Conclusions: Homelessness presents acute stress for mothers that diminishes over time after families rehouse. In addition, improvements in maternal mental health fail to explain prior findings that associated FCTI with benefits in child and adolescent behavior. Taken together, FCTI with connection to affordable housing provides a useful approach with homeless families; however, additional research needs to articulate mechanisms involved in the intervention.","Comments":"Samuels, Judith Fowler, Patrick J.

This article seeks to address this gap, with a review focused on outcomes associated with participation in HF programs. Specifically, we investigate the details of program design coupled with specific outcomes, so as to better inform future action and research. We conclude that the research forming the evidence base for HF is methodologically strong. However, additional research is needed to determine the benefits of HF for diverse populations. Additional research is also required to conclusively determine the impact of HF on substance use and psychiatric treatment. We recommend that policy-makers consider the needs of local populations when developing and implementing HF programing.","Comments":"Woodhall-Melnik, Julia R.

A recent scoping review on housing and wellbeing identified a lack of review-level evidence around the impact of housing interventions on wellbeing of people who are vulnerable to discrimination or exclusion in relation to housing (Preston et al., 2016).. This systematic review was commissioned to address that gap. We synthesise and consider the quality of evidence on how housing interventions can contribute to improving the lives of adults who are vulnerable in relation to the security of their housing tenure (‘housing-vulnerable’ adults).\r\rResults\rLiterature search: 90 publications were included in the review, divided into clusters as follows:\r•\tHousing First (47)\r•\tOther interventions for homeless people with mental health problems (11)\r•\tRecovery housing (10)\r•\tSupported housing (12)\r•\tHousing interventions for ex-prisoners (7)\r•\tHousing intervention for vulnerable young people (3)\r\rSummary of key findings: Housing First provides immediate access to housing without preconditions with support by either mobile teams or on-site services. Housing First has been evaluated in the UK, in a large Canadian randomised trial (AH/CS), in the USA and other settings. Based on our findings, there is strong evidence that Housing First can improve housing stability and measures of physical health in the short term. Evidence was classed as moderate for positive effects on personal wellbeing, mental health and locality-related wellbeing (‘where we live’) and for absence of effect on personal finance and community wellbeing. Strength of evidence for other outcomes was rated as low or very low. Research identified a range of factors that can affect the effectiveness of Housing First, including fidelity to core components and whether the service is delivered in one place or service users are dispersed in separate apartments.\r\rWhat we classified as ‘other interventions for people with mental/physical health problems’ (11 papers) formed a heterogeneous group of complex interventions. A key finding was that these interventions provide an opportunity for recovery but not everyone benefits. One study suggested that outcomes may be mediated by baseline health status rather than type of intervention. Only one UK study was included in this group.\r\rTen papers examined recovery housing, which is specifically for alcohol or substance use problems. The review found some randomised trial evidence but this was of limited applicability to UK settings. A key finding was that recovery houses can improve personal wellbeing through promoting abstinence from alcohol or illegal drugs. Supported housing (12 papers) is a related but broader concept, for which we included no evidence from the UK. Despite this we found moderate strength of evidence for a positive effect on housing stability. However, strength of evidence for wellbeing outcomes was low or very low. \r\rFinally, we examined interventions for other specific groups of housing-vulnerable people. Of seven studies on ex-prisoners, five were from the UK (England),, suggesting relatively high transferability/applicability to similar settings. The main outcome examined in the studies was reduction in offending, which could be linked to both community and individual wellbeing. Three UK studies of housing interventions for vulnerable young people showed generally positive outcomes for wellbeing but the studies were small, short-term and generally uncontrolled.\r\rThere was a general lack of evidence around measures related to community wellbeing and around cost-effectiveness of the interventions investigated. Only a small number of economic evaluations were included and their relevance to the UK varied (economic studies are sensitive to local context and the results are unlikely to be generalisable between different settings).\r\rConceptual pathway: We used the synthesised evidence to develop a conceptual pathway to illustrate the links between housing and wellbeing for housing-vulnerable people. The pathway proceeds from the initial offer of housing through to longer-term outcomes associated with different types of intervention (defined as 2 years or more). The pathway is structured as a ‘logic model’, highlighting key intermediate outcomesmediators (central elements that may explain changes) and moderators (barriers and facilitators that may influence outcomes).\r\rConclusions\r\rImplications for policy and practice: The findings of this systematic review highlight the complexity of the relationship between housing and wellbeing. Overall, we did not find sufficient evidence to demonstrate a linear relationship between housing interventions for vulnerable people, improved housing and improved wellbeing for the individual or community. This may reflect both limitations of the evidence base (relatively few high-quality studies reporting on core wellbeing outcomes) and the complexity of the relationship between housing and wellbeing for vulnerable people with complex needs.  It follows that the findings may be difficult to translate into ‘actionable messages’ for policy and practice. Providing housing support for vulnerable people is clearly necessary but may not always be sufficient to improve their wellbeing and that of the community as a whole. The conceptual pathway presented in section 11.3 highlights some of the plausible mechanisms leading to improvements and the associated key moderating factors. In considering how to apply the evidence, decision-makers also need to take into account the wider context, including pressure on local authority budgets and changes in the political environment.\r\rEvidence gaps and implications for research: This review has identified substantial evidence gaps. There is a need for further high quality evaluations of interventions that have been or may be implemented in the UK, particularly outside England.. There is a particular requirement for well-designed economic evaluations and studies focusing on the wellbeing dimensions that have been relatively under-researched to date, for example links between vulnerable-housing interventions and education and skills and community wellbeing outcomes.\r\rAccompanying cost-effectiveness model: Alongside the systematic review the research team also conducted a cost-effectiveness model of Housing First (Wright et al., 2018). This assessed the costs and benefits of Housing First versus a Staircase model over a two-year period and considered the uncertainty around costs and benefits for both approaches. \r\rMethods\rWe searched six bibliographic databases, performed reference and citation checking and searched the websites of university departments and charities with expertise in housing. We also issued a call for evidence through the What Works Centre for Wellbeing (WWCW).\r","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chambers D ; Cantrell A ; Preston L ; Peasgood T ; Paisley S ; Clowes M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4691460,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691470,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691473,"AdditionalText":"UK","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691474,"AdditionalText":"USA","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691484,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691485,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691479,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691480,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691483,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691487,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691490,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691491,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691492,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691497,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691512,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691514,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691515,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691496,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691499,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691511,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691519,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691521,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691537,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691539,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691540,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691541,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691549,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691550,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691551,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691552,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691555,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691557,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691558,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4691561,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":4814919,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413936,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5413940,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437012,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437013,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437017,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437018,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437022,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437030,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437032,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437033,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437040,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437042,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437045,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437046,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437051,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""},{"AttributeId":5437059,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":""}]}];
